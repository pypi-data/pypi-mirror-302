When
    Initial commit: 2015-09-09

Where
    * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gouge
    * https://github.com/exhuma/gouge

Why
    Because I want to the same log behaviour across all of my applications.


Installation
------------

::

    $ pip install gouge


Background
----------

``gouge`` started off as a way to share logging formatters across all my
applications. Starting with version 1.2, it now also contains the
:py:class:`gouge.filter.ShiftingFilter <first filter>`. Again, to share the
same behaviour across applications.

It is very "thin", and has no dependencies other than :py:mod:`blessings`.
:py:mod:`blessings` is only used for formatting (colour, bold, â€¦) and it does
not have any external dependencies itself. At least not at the time of this
writing.

I have a fair amount of applications which log to the console. While the
default formatting given by :py:func:`logging.basicConfig()` is usable, I
always end up modifying it. Mostly just adding horizontal whitespace to make it
more readable. Adding colour helps, and I've added it to some projects. My
co-workers are in the same boat, and we end up copy/pasting logging formatters
all over the place. The end-result: All projects have a slightly different
formatting.

The aims of ``gouge`` are:

* be a repository of simple drop-in (and reusable) logging formatters.
* have a more uniform looking output across multiple applications.
* make formatting of the logs a simple one-liner.
* provide additional functionality complementing the standard logging
  framework.


Why the name "gouge"?
---------------------

A "gouge_" is a type of chisel. A tool used in woodworking. And as this module
applies some style to the "logging" module, I found this an appropriate name
for the project. As "chisel" is already taken as a Python module, this was the
next best choice.

Examples
========

Simple Usage example
--------------------

::

    import logging
    from gouge.colourcli import Simple
    Simple.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    logging.info('Hello World!')


In this case, :py:meth:`~gouge.colourcli.Simple.basicConfig` is directly passed
on to :py:meth:`logging.basicConfig` but will pepper things up by overriding
the ``format`` argument of the defaul ``basicConfig`` implementation.


Manual Usage
------------

::

    import logging

    from gouge.colourcli import Simple


    LOG = logging.getLogger()
    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    handler.setFormatter(Simple())

    LOG.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    LOG.addHandler(handler)
    LOG.debug('hello')
    LOG.info('hello')
    LOG.warning('hello')
    LOG.error('hello')


Usage with dictConfig
---------------------

When using ``dictConfig``, you can use the ``gouge.colourcli.Simple`` formatter as class:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    LOGGING = {
        "version": 1,
        "disable_existing_loggers": False,
        "formatters": {
            "myFormatter": {
                "()": "gouge.colourcli.Simple",
                "show_exc": True,
                "show_threads": True,
                "show_pid": True,
            },
        },
        "handlers": {
            "console": {
                "class": "logging.StreamHandler",
                "formatter": "myFormatter",
            },
        },
        "loggers": {
            "": {
                "handlers": ["console"],
                'level": "DEBUG",
            },
        },
    }

    logging.config.dictConfig(LOGGING)
    logging.debug("hello")
    logging.info("hello")
    logging.warning("hello")
    logging.error("hello")



Caveats
=======

You should be aware, that the ``basicConfig`` methods are fairly intrusive.
They first call :py:func:`logging.basicConfig()`, then look for every
``stdout`` and every ``stderr`` handler attached to the root logger and replace
their formatter.


Themes
======

Currently I only use the :py:class:`~gouge.colourcli.Simple` theme. I may or
may not add new themes to the project. I am open for pull-requests as long as
they don't include hefty dependencies!

As sort of a "demo", I also added :py:class:`~gouge.parseable.CSVLog` and
:py:class:`~gouge.parseable.XMLLog`.


Pre-Formatters
==============

.. versionadded:: 2.1

To modify the message-string *before* it is formatted by *gouge* you can pass
the ``pre_formatters`` argument to the :py:class:`gouge.colourcli.Simple`
constructor.

This can turn something like this:

.. figure:: _static/pre-formatter-not-applied.png
    :alt: Pre-Formatter not applied

    This shows the default output. The "message" has a single color.

into this:

.. figure:: _static/pre-formatter-applied.png
    :alt: Pre-Formatter applied

    This shows an output with a custom formatter applied to the message alone.

Gouge comes (at the time of this writing) with a bundled formatter for the
``uvicorn.access`` logger (as displayed above). See
:py:mod:`gouge.preformatters` for a sample implementation.


Applying Pre-Formatters
-----------------------

Pre-formatters are passed as a dictionary mapping from logger-names to
a list of formatting functions (callables). The functions take the raw message
as input and must return the formatted message.

Pre-formatters for a logger are applied in sequence.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Pre-Formatter Example

    from gouge.colourcli import Simple

    def my_preformatter(message: str) -> str:
        return message.upper()

    my_log_formatter = Simple(pre_formatters={"my.logger": [my_preformatter]})

Using Pre-Formatters With dictConfig
-------------------------------------

This example demostrates the use of the builtin ``uvicorn_access``
pre-formatter.

When using :py:func:`logging.config.dictConfig`, you can provide a subclass of
``Simple()`` as so:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Pre-Formatter for log-config files

    from gouge.preformatters import uvicorn_access

    class MyFormatter(Simple):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(
                *args,
                pre_formatters={
                    "uvicorn.access": [uvicorn_access]
                },
                **kwargs,
            )


and then use it in the log-config as so:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: Example config for dictConfig

    ---
    version: 1
    root:
      level: DEBUG
      handlers:
        - console
    loggers:
      # uvicorn loggers are pretty silent by default. We set some of them to INFO.
      # This will make the messages (which are usfeul during development) appear in
      # the console.
      # uvicorn.error contains startup messages.
      uvicorn.error:
        level: INFO
      # uvicorn.access contains access logs.
      uvicorn.access:
        level: INFO
    handlers:
      console:
        class : logging.StreamHandler
        formatter: gouge
    formatters:
      gouge:
        class: "powonline.logging.LogFormatter"
