    "# Modelling the Mobility of Dislocations with `matscipy`\n",
    "The dislocation modelling toolkit provided in `matscipy.dislocation` includes functions to assist in characterising the mobility of dislocations in various systems. Currently, only motion in the glide direction is supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dislocation Glide\n",
    "Dislocation Glide is where the dislocation line migrates in the glide direction. There are two main mechanisms for attempting to describe dislocation glide dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first mechanism is the (double) kink mechanism. Starting from a perfectly straight dislocation line, a small segment  nucleates out in the glide directionforming a pair of dislocation kinks. These kinks can then migrate along the dislocation line.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second, simpler mechanism is to consider the entire dislocation line moving at once - this is much less physical than the double kink mechanism, but can be a good first approximation. The 2D nature of this mechanism can also make it much simpler to study, rather than having to deal with the fully 3D kinks.\n",

    "## Dislocation Kink\n",
    "Dislocation kink is often the preferred mechanism for migration of the dislocation line. It involves a short segment of the dislocation line hopping by one glide vector, which then provides a low barrier for the rest of the dislocation line to migrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the space of structures to explore is greater, due to the 3D nature of dislocation kink. Kink nucleation is also possible on segments of an already kinked-out dislocation line, which can lead to a full network of dislocation kinks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Kink maps\n",
    "Dislocation kink in `matscipy` is controlled by a kink map, which controls the position of the dislocation line as a function of the vertical coordinate. The kink map is a list of integers, where the values give a line position in units of glide distances, and each element corresponds to an extra cell in z (replication of `disloc.unit_cell`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A kink map of `[0, 0, 1, 1]` means that the dislocation line initially starts at position zero for two repetitions, and then moves out by one glide distance for two repetitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both dislocation cylinders and quadrupoles have support for this kind of kink map, but the periodic boundaries are treated differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "In dislocation cylinders (using `build_kink_cyl`), the periodicity in z is enforced by requiring that the dislocation line returns back to the initial position across the periodic boundary. The example kink map of `[0, 0, 1, 1]` will therefore have a single kink out in the center of the cell, and a single kink back at the periodic boundary (the dislocation line will go like `0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, ...`).\n",
    "\n",
    "In quadrupoles (using `build_kink_quadrupole_network`), the cell is modified such that the dislocation position at the top of the cell becomes the new dislocation line position at the bottom of the cell. This means that for quadrupoles an extra kink will not be created, and that the example map of `[0, 0, 1, 1]` will create only one kink in the center of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the kink map is just a list of integers, it can be more convenient to exploit list addition, and specify kink maps in a form similar to `[0] * 5 + [1] * 5`, which would be identical to the input of `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n",
