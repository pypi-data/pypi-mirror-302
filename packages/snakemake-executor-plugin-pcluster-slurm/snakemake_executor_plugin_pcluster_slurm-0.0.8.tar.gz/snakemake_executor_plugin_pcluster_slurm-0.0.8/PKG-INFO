# Snakemake executor plugin: pcluster-slurm v_0.0.7_

**[the core of this plugin was lifted from the official slurm pluging, via this fork](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/snakemake-executor-plugin-pcluster-slurm-ref)**.

## `pcluster-slurm` plugin
### AWS Parallel Cluster, `pcluster` `slurm`
[AWS Parallel Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) is a framework to deploy and manage dynamically scalable HPC clusters on AWS, running SLURM as the batch system, and `pcluster` manages all of the creating, configuring, and deleting of the cluster compute nodes. Nodes may be spot or dedicated.  **note**, the `AWS Parallel Cluster` port of slurm has a few small, but critical differences from the standard slurm distribution.  This plugin enables using slurm from pcluster head and compute nodes via snakemake `>=v8.*`.

#### [Daylily Bfx Framework](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily)
[Daylily](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily) is a bioinformatics framework that automates and standardizes all aspects of creating a self-scaling ephemeral cluster which can grow from 1 head node to many thousands of as-needed compute spot instances (modulo your quotas and budget). This is accomplished by using [AWS Parallel Cluster](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/parallelcluster/) to manage the cluster, and snakemake to manage the bfx workflows. In this context, `slurm` is the intermediary between snakemake and the cluster resource management. The `pcluster` slurm variant does not play nicely with vanilla slurm, and to date, the slurm snakemake executor has not worked with `pcluster` slurm. This plugin is a bridge between snakemake and `pcluster-slurm`.



# Pre-requisites
## Snakemake >=8.*
### Conda
```bash
conda create -n snakemake -c conda-forge -c bioconda snakemake==8.20.6
conda activate snakemake
```

# Installation (pip)
_from an environment with snakemake and pip installed_
```bash
pip install snakemake-executor-plugin-pcluster-slurm
```

# Example Usage [daylily cluster headnode](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily)
```bash
mkdir -p /fsx/resources/environments/containers/ubuntu/cache/
export SNAKEMAKE_OUTPUT_CACHE=/fsx/resources/environments/containers/ubuntu/cache/
snakemake --use-conda --use-singularity -j 10  --singularity-prefix /fsx/resources/environments/containers/ubuntu/ip-10-0-0-240/ --singularity-args "  -B /tmp:/tmp -B /fsx:/fsx  -B /home/$USER:/home/$USER -B $PWD/:$PWD" --conda-prefix /fsx/resources/environments/containers/ubuntu/ip-10-0-0-240/ --executor pcluster-slurm --default-resources slurm_partition='i64,i128,i192' --cache  --verbose -k
```
