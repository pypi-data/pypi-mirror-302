Processing tools and tutorials for users of the C3S satellite soil moisture
service ( https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.d7782f18 ). Written in Python.

Installation
============

The c3s_sm package and all required dependencies can be installed via

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install c3s_sm

On macOS if you get ``ImportError: Pykdtree failed to import its C extension``, then it
might be necessary to install the pykdtree package from conda-forge

.. code-block:: shell

    conda install -c conda-forge pykdtree

Tutorials
=========

We provide tutorials on using the C3S Soil Moisture data:

- `Tutorial 1: DataAccess from CDS & Anomaly computation <https://c3s-sm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/T1_DataAccess_Anomalies.html>`_

These tutorials are designed to run on `mybinder.org <mybinder.org/>`_
You can find the code for all examples in
`this repository <https://github.com/TUW-GEO/c3s_sm-tutorials>`_.

Supported Products
==================

At the moment this package supports C3S soil moisture data
in netCDF format (reading and time series creation)
with a spatial sampling of 0.25 degrees.

Build Docker image
==================
- Check out the repo at the branch/tag/commit you want build
- Make sure you have docker installed and run the command (replace the tag `latest`
  with something more meaningful, e.g. a matching version number)

.. code::

    docker build -t c3s_sm:latest . 2>&1 | tee docker_build.log

This will execute the commands from the Dockerfile. I.e. install a new environment
with the checked out version of the c3s_sm package.

To build and publish the image online, we have a GitHub Actions workflow in
``.github/workflows/docker.yml``
