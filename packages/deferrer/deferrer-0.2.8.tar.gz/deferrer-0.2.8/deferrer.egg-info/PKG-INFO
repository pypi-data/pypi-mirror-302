## Installation and usage

### Installation

You may install `deferrer` by running `pip install deferrer`.

### Usage

There are two designed ways to use `defer`. You may use either of them, or mix them up.

#### Sugarful

```python
>>> from deferrer import defer

>>> def f():
...     defer and print(0)
...     defer and print(1)
...     print(2)
...     defer and print(3)
...     defer and print(4)

>>> import sys
>>> if sys.version_info < (3, 12):
...     from deferrer import defer_scope
...     f = defer_scope(f)

>>> f()
2
4
3
1
0

```

#### Sugarless

```python
>>> from deferrer import defer

>>> def f():
...     defer(print)(0)
...     defer(print)(1)
...     print(2)
...     defer(print)(3)
...     defer(print)(4)

>>> import sys
>>> if sys.version_info < (3, 12):
...     from deferrer import defer_scope
...     f = defer_scope(f)
