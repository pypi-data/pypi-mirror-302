## Typing stubs for icalendar

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`icalendar`](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`icalendar`.

This version of `types-icalendar` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `icalendar==6.0.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/icalendar. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.

[`a871efd90ca2734b3341dde98cffab66f3e08cee`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/a871efd90ca2734b3341dde98cffab66f3e08cee) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.383, and
pytype 2024.10.11.
