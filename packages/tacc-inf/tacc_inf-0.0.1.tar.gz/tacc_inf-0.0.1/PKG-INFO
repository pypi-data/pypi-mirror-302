# TACC Inference: Easy Inference on Slurm Clusters

This repository provides an easy-to-use solution to run inference servers on [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html)-managed computing clusters using [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/). **All scripts in this repository runs natively on the TACC cluster environment**.

> [!Note]
> TACC Inference is a fork of [VectorInstitute/vector-inference](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/vector-inference). This is a work in progress.

# Installation

Clone this repository and install the package via `pip`:

```bash
# I'm using miniconda; feel free to use your favourite package manager.
$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh -O $WORK/bin/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
$ bash $WORK/bin/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -u -p $WORK/bin/miniconda3
# Install tacc-inf package
(base) $ pip install tacc-inf
(base) $ tacc-inf --help
```

Alternatively, if you intend to modify the `tacc-inf` package:

```bash
(base) $ git clone <this repo>
(base) $ cd <repo directory>
(base) $ pip install .
(base) $ tacc-inf --help
```

## Install vLLM Singularity Container

Rather than installing vLLM directly on TACC, we run vLLM via a Singularity container. Learn how TACC integrates with Singularity containers [here](https://containers-at-tacc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/singularity/01.singularity_basics.html). You have three options to install the container on `vista` (`aarch64` microarchitecture; GH100 GPUs):

### Option 1: Use a Precompiled Container

```bash
# Option 1: Get atharva's vLLM Docker container.
$ ls /home1/08277/asehgal/work/vista/tacc-inference/static/llm-train-serve_aarch64.sif
# <should echo the path; if it gives an error, I haven't set the permissions correctly and you should open a github issue or browse for solutions on closed issues.>
$ cp /home1/08277/asehgal/work/vista/tacc-inference/static/llm-train-serve_aarch64.sif static/llm-train-serve_aarch64.sif
```

### Option 2: Build the Docker Container Yourself

```bash
# Option 2: Make the docker container yourself.
$ cd static/
# Commission a node for 20 minutes.
$ idev -p gh-dev -N 1 -n 1 -t 00:20:00
$ module load tacc-apptainer
# Build the apptainer config from the llm-train-serve github (build for GH200 with an aarch64 microarchitecture but works for vista)
$ apptainer build llm-train-serve_aarch64.sif docker://ghcr.io/abacusai/gh200-llm/llm-train-serve@sha256:4ba3de6b19e8247ce5d351bf7dd41aa41bb3bffe8c790b7a2f4077af74c1b4ab
# Confirm that the SIF file file is in $WORK/tacc-inference/static with this exact name.
$ ls $WORK/tacc-inference/static
llm-train-serve_aarch64.sif
# Free up the dev compute node.
$ logout
```

### Option 3: Install vLLM from Scratch

This method is not well-tested. You may need to adjust the `*.slurm` files if you proceed. I cannot guarantee that this will work.

```bash
# Option 3: Compile your own version of vLLM
# https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#use-an-existing-pytorch-installation
# Don't use the conda environment.
$ conda deactivate
# Commission a node for 40 minutes as it might take longer.
$ idev -p gh-dev -N 1 -n 1 -t 00:40:00
$ module load gcc/14.2.0 cuda/12.5
$ module load python3
$ python3 -m venv $WORK/tacc-inference/vllm_env
$ source activate $WORK/tacc-inference/vllm_env
# Install PyTorch for aarch64.
(vllm_env) $ pip3 install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu124
# Download, setup, and build vLLM.
(vllm_env) $ git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.git
(vllm_env) $ cd vllm
(vllm_env) $ python use_existing_torch.py
(vllm_env) $ pip install -r requirements-build.txt
(vllm_env) $ pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
(vllm_env) $ pip install tacc-inference
# Update `*.slurm` to use source activate $WORK/tacc-inference/vllm_env.
```

## Download a Model from Hugging Face

> [!TIP]
> Downloading on your local machine and transferring to TACC with rsync/scp proves to be much faster than downloading on TACC directly.

```bash
# The vllm.slurm script expects models to be here
$ mkdir -p $WORK/tacc-inference/model-weights
# We're going to download the model from huggingface.
$ pip install huggingface-hub
$ huggingface-cli login
# Assume we want to download and use Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
# First, verify that models.csv contains this model
$ cat tacc_inf/models/models.csv | grep Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
# Make a folder to hold these model weights
$ mkdir -p $WORK/tacc-inference/model-weights/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/
# Download from huggingface.
$ huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --local-dir $WORK/tacc-inference/model-weights/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct/
```

## Launch an Inference Server

We will use the Llama 3.1 model as example, to launch an OpenAI compatible inference server for `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct`, run:
```bash
$ tacc-inf launch Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --time 00:10:00

The model would be launched using the [default parameters](tacc_inf/models/models.csv), you can override these values by providing additional options, use `--help` to see the full list. You can also launch your own customized model as long as the model architecture is [supported by vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/models/supported_models.html), you'll need to specify all model launching related options to run a successful run.

You can check the inference server status by providing the Slurm job ID to the `status` command:
```bash
tacc-inf status 13014393
```

You should see an output like the following:

<img width="400" alt="status_img" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7385b9ca-9159-4ca9-bae2-7e26d80d9747">

There are 5 possible states:

* **PENDING**: Job submitted to Slurm, but not executed yet. Job pending reason will be shown.
* **LAUNCHING**: Job is running but the server is not ready yet.
* **READY**: Inference server running and ready to take requests.
* **FAILED**: Inference server in an unhealthy state. Job failed reason will be shown.
* **SHUTDOWN**: Inference server is shutdown/cancelled.

Note that the base URL is only available when model is in `READY` state, and if you've changed the Slurm log directory path, you also need to specify it when using the `status` command.

Finally, when you're finished using a model, you can shut it down by providing the Slurm job ID:
```bash
tacc-inf shutdown 13014393

> Shutting down model with Slurm Job ID: 13014393
```

You call view the full list of available models by running the `list` command:
```bash
tacc-inf list
```
<img width="1200" alt="list_img" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4f0d896-989d-43bf-82a2-6a6e5d0d288f">

You can also view the default setup for a specific supported model by providing the model name, for example `Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct`:
```bash
tacc-inf list Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
```
<img width="400" alt="list_model_img" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dec7a33-ba6b-490d-af47-4cf7341d0b42">

`launch`, `list`, and `status` command supports `--json-mode`, where the command output would be structured as a JSON string.

## Send inference requests
Once the inference server is ready, you can start sending in inference requests. We provide example scripts for sending inference requests in [`examples`](examples) folder. Make sure to update the model server URL and the model weights location in the scripts. For example, you can run `python examples/inference/llm/completions.py`, and you should expect to see an output like the following:
> {"id":"cmpl-c08d8946224747af9cce9f4d9f36ceb3","object":"text_completion","created":1725394970,"model":"Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct","choices":[{"index":0,"text":" is a question that many people may wonder. The answer is, of course, Ottawa. But if","logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"length","stop_reason":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":8,"total_tokens":28,"completion_tokens":20}}

**NOTE**: For multimodal models, currently only `ChatCompletion` is available, and only one image can be provided for each prompt.

## SSH tunnel from your local device
If you want to run inference from your local device, you can open a SSH tunnel to your cluster environment like the following:
```bash
ssh -L 8081:172.17.8.29:8081 username@v.vectorinstitute.ai -N
```
Where the last number in the URL is the GPU number (gpu029 in this case). The example provided above is for the vector cluster, change the variables accordingly for your environment
