        - For two random variables, ``x`` and ``y``, the function returns

        The cross-covariance of two normal variables 
        is an array ``c`` with the dimension number equal 
        to the sum of the dimensions of ``x`` and ``y``, whose components are

        of ``x`` and ``y``, respectively, and ``*`` denotes complex conjugation.

        The cross-covariance of two sparse variables is an array 
        with the dimension number equal to the sum of the dense dimensions 
        of ``x`` and ``y``, plus the number of their sparse (independence) 
        dimensions, which should be the same in ``x`` and ``y``. 
        In the returned array, the regular dimensions 
        go first in the order they appear in the variable shapes, 
        and the independence dimensions are appended at the end.
        The resulting structure is the same as the structure produced 
        by repeated applications of `np.diagonal` over all the 
        independence dimensions of the full-sized covariance matrix ``c`` 
        for ``x`` and ``y``.
