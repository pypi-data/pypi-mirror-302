- [OK](https://okpy.org/) which is used in [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/) at University of California, Berkeley. It implements the concept of
  "test case unlocking" that promotes "multi-stage problem solving process." [paper](http://denero.org/content/pubs/las15_basu_unlocking.pdf).
- [check50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/projects/check50/en/latest/) which is used in [CS 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) at Harvard University. There are also [various other command line tools](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/).
- Cafe Grader's [judge-script](https://github.com/cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-judge-scripts) and its [web UI](https://github.com/cafe-grader-team/cafe-grader-web) which is (was?; well at least in 2010-ish) used by Department of Computer Engineering at Kasetsart University, Thailand.

This library is somewhat inspired by Cafe Grader Suite and OK.
