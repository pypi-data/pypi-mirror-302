v0.3.3.2 (04 / 16 / 2020)
--------------------------
Release of new version including fix to sensor orientation, increased py-testing, and glass in modules. 


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Glass in modules now supported. New Glass material included in `ground.rad`. Example of use in `Glass Tutorials <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_.  
* Source code for `gencumulativesky` is now included along with `makefile` instructions in ``/data/gencumsky/``
* New Torquetube options added on :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeModule`
* Added variables ``frontsurfaceoffset`` and ``backsurfaceoffset`` to :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.AnalysisObj.moduleAnalysis`, to offer the ability of controling the offset in local z of the sensor locations from the module's front and rear surface. 

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~
* :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.readTMY` now saves the temporal TMY files generated for daydate simulations with different titles to avoid overwriting in parallel simulations.
* Input for daydate added to :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.analysis1axis`, allowing to save cumulative files for daydate. 
* Sorted trackerdict keys on simulations that use trackerdict routines
* Removed deprecation warning and inputs ``nMods`` and ``nRows`` on :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis`
* Modified `quickExample()` to include testfolder as an input, and returned analysis results. Call to interactive directory selection called from `main.py` instead than being redefined inside the function. (:issue:`201`)
* Removed `HPCExample()` function from `main.py` (added as a `Tutorial Notebook <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_)
* Fix GUI load issue when `None` values passed
* Set GUI default ``modWanted`` and ``rowWanted`` to `Null`
* :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.load.readconfigurationinputfile`.ini input files now use the key ``timeIndexSimulation`` instead of ``timestampRangeSimulation``


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
* Fixed sensor's orientation error in scanning function calculation, mainly affecting high-tilt angle simulations (:issue:`226`)
* Fix GUI to allow reading null values for ``modWanted`` and ``rowWanted``
* Exception handling for daily simulations in :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.gendaylit1axis`, due to a for loop going out of range for endindex+1 (:issue:`225`)


Testing
~~~~~~~
* Modified pytest assertions for skies to avoid OS issues (ski\etc or skie//etc)
* Added pytesting to :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.getSingleTimestampTrackerAngle`
* Added pytesting to `sceneDict` ``height`` in :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis`
* Added pytesting for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.AnalysisObj.makeImage` and py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.AnalysisObj.makeFalseColor`
* Added pytest for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.gendaylit2manual` 
* Added pytest for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.genCumSky` in py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.modelchain.runModelChain`
* Added pytest for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.genCumSky1axis` on ``test_1axis_genCumSky()``
* Added pytest for `torque tubes` :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeModule`
* Added pytest for `pitch` and `gcr` on :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.makeScene1axis` (:issue:`204`)
* Added pytest to ``quickExample`` (:issue:`201`)
* Added pytest for :py:class:`~bifacial_radiance.RadianceObj.getEPW`


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Updated bifacial_radiance D.O.E. reference citation on index. (:issue:`213`)
* New `Tutorial on AgriPV <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_
* New `Tutorial on running High Performance Computing (HPC) <https://github.com/NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_
* Added `Webinar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X9L-R-RVGA>`_ Slides and Journal on `Tutorials <https://github.com.NREL/bifacial_radiance/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_ 
* Added `pip install` options to :ref:`installation` 
* Added software compatibility to :ref:`installation` (:issue:`190`) 
* Added Linux and MacOS instructions to :ref:`installation` (:issue:`198`) 
* Added content to :ref:`package_overview` section (:issue:`191`)
* Added `intended audience` to documentation and main Github Readme (:issue:`192`)
* Platform and python-version updates throughout documentation (:issue:`198`)
* Improvements to :ref:`contributing` guidelines (:issue:`191`)(:issue:`196`)
* Working Folder path fixed on Tutorial Journals for compatibility with other OS Systems (:issue:`217`)
* Updated Youtube's installation instructions to mention how to pip install bifacial_radiance, pip install pvlib, and comments for Linux/Mac OSX users to read the install guide on readthedocs.
* Added suggestion to install Anaconda to run Jupyter Tutorial notebooks in :ref:`installation` (:issue:`194`)
