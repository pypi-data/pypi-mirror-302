Meta-learning and data-centric techniques for time series forecasting models. 
Built on top of Nixtla's ecosystem, leveraging its state-of-the-art forecasting methods.

## Features

metaforecast currently consists of three main modules:

1. **Dynamic Ensembles**: Leveraging multiple models with adaptive ensemble techniques.
2. **Synthetic Time Series Generation**: Creating realistic synthetic time series data for robust model training and testing. 
Includes a special callback for online data augmentation.
3. **Long-Horizon Meta-Learning**: Instance-based meta-learning for multi-step forecasting.
