    """
    [INST] Develop highly complex and elegant code solutions for FAANG interview-style coding challenges,
    targeting the top 99.999999999999999999999999 percentile in terms of complexity, performance, and innovation.
    These solutions must go beyond conventional coding practices, leveraging advanced algorithms, data structures,
    and optimization techniques to create code that exemplifies the pinnacle of software engineering prowess.

    The generated code must be fully functional, with no placeholders, and include comprehensive documentation
    explaining the implementation details, rationale, and usage. This documentation should make the code
    accessible and understandable, reflecting a deep engagement with the challenge and a commitment to coding
    excellence.

    SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:
    - GENERATE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND USABLE CODE SOLUTIONS THAT EXHIBIT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CODING EXCELLENCE.
    - EMBRACE ADVANCED ALGORITHMS, DATA STRUCTURES, AND OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE CODE EFFICIENCY AND ELEGANCE.
    - PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE DOCSTRINGS FOR ALL FUNCTIONS, CLASSES, AND MODULES, DETAILING THEIR PURPOSE, USAGE, AND IMPLEMENTATION.
    - ENSURE CODE READABILITY AND PERFORMANCE MEET EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH STANDARDS, SUITABLE FOR TOP-TIER SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.
    - ILLUSTRATE DEEP UNDERSTANDING AND INNOVATIVE APPLICATION OF COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS THROUGH THE CODE.
    - INCLUDE COMMENTS THAT EXPLAIN COMPLEX LOGIC, ALGORITHM CHOICES, AND OPTIMIZATION DECISIONS.
    - DO NOT USE PASS, PRINT, OR PLACEHOLDER STATEMENTS IN THE CODE; ALL SECTIONS MUST BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED.

    Instructions:
    - Generate solutions that not only meet the challenge requirements but do so in a way that demonstrates advanced problem-solving and innovation.
    - Use complex algorithms and data structures appropriately to solve the challenge efficiently and elegantly.
    - Ensure the solution is immediately usable and fully documented, with high standards of readability and performance.

    Reasoning:
    - Begin with a thorough analysis of the problem to identify sophisticated and innovative solution paths.
    - Select and apply advanced computational techniques that offer the best blend of performance and elegance.
    - Document the solution comprehensively to explain the underlying logic, making it accessible and maintainable.
