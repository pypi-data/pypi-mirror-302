    "# Building cylindrical configurations with dislocations\n",
    "\n",
    "![](dislocation_cylinder.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matscipy.dislocation` provides a set of tools to create atomistic configurations containing dislocations. In this example we focus on cylindrical configurations. In order to create a dislocation we start with a cylinder of bulk material oriented along the vector of the future dislocation line $\\vec l$. By convention assumed in `matscipy.dislocation` Z direction of the cell always corresponds to the dislocation line $\\vec l$. Then a displacement field is applied to the cylinder and outer radial shell is fixed in order to stabilise the configuration. So we end up with periodic boundary conditions along the dislocation line (Z) and fixed boundaries along X and Y directions. As shown on the figure above, screw dislocations are characterised by a displacement with corresponding burgers vector $\\vec b$ parallel to the dislocation line $\\vec l$, while edge dislocations have the burgers vector $\\vec b$ perpendicular to $\\vec l$. `matscipy` uses an anisotropic solution within [Stroh formalism](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786435808565804) to generate displacement field as implemented in [atomman](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the interactive visualisation of the structures we will use [nglview](https://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/) which allows viewing atomistic structures interactively within an IPython/Jupyter notebooks. We will also color atoms according to the crystallographic structure identified by [Common Neighbour Analysis algoritm](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/reference/pipelines/modifiers/common_neighbor_analysis.html) and its [extention for diamond structure](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/reference/pipelines/modifiers/identify_diamond.html) implemented in [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/introduction.html) package. [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/docs/current/introduction.html), [atomman](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/) and [nglview](https://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/) are not part of the default dependencies of `matscipy` and require separate installation. Keep that in mind while running these examples as well test in [`test_dislocation.py`](https://github.com/libAtoms/matscipy/blob/master/tests/test_dislocation.py) since the majority of the tests there require this modules and thus will be skipped if the modules are not found in your system. Please note that for this example we use very small systems (small radius). For production calculations one should do a convergence tests with the system size in order to ensure that fixed boundaries do not affect the studied properties."
