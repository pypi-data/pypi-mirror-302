## Structure Inspector

`structure_inspector` is a Python package that allows you to print the structure of complex, nested Python objects. It supports dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, and more. You can also display lengths of lists and strings, handle circular references, and limit recursion depth.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install structure_inspector
```

## Usage

```python
from structure_inspector import StructureInspector

nested_object = {
    "name": "Laura Dam",
    "details": {
        "age": 35,
        "children": [
            {"name": "Van Dam", "age": 10},
            {"name": "Zay Cola", "age": 5}
        ]
    },
}

inspector = StructureInspector(max_depth=3, show_lengths=True)
inspector.print_structure(nested_object)
```
