# Purpose

The Intermodal Routing and Environmental Impact Analysis Tool (IREIAT) is meant to enable its target user group,
infrastructure planners, to understand:
1. Expected flows on the US intermodal freight network given demand,
   intermodal costs (both direct financial and other costs), and network capacities
2. How cost, transit time, disruptions/resilience, and GHG emissions affect freight flows across the current and
   future intermodal network

# Quick start

The tool is meant to be a Python-based command line tool, so you should ensure
that you have Python 3.11 installed on your machine, which
can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3117/).

Additionally, you need to download R and install:
* cppRouting
* igraph
* arrow

Once you have Python and R installed you should be able to install the package
with `pip install ireiat`. After which, you can just run `ireiat` from a command-line!

Run `ireiat --help` for CLI options or see the [full documentation](https://ireiat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
