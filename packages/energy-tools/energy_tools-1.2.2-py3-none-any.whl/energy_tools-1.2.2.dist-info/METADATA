## Installation

```
pip install -U --user energy_tools
```

### Development version

`energy_tools` is now managed with `uv`. After downloading or cloning the project from GitHub, run `uv sync` to fetch and install the requirements.

You can then test the installation with `make tests` or `uv run python -m pytest`.

## Features

`energy_tools` currently includes the following modules:

### complex

The `complex` module includes an improved `EleComplex` class which adds the following attributes (properties): `phase`, `module`.

- `EleComplex.phase` returns the complex number's phase in degrees.
- `EleComplex.module` returns the complex number's amplitude.

The `complex` module also includes a `complex_impedance` function that returns an improved `EleComplex` number, based on a provided real impedance *z* and an *X/R* ratio.

The `EleComplex` class must be imported in order for some of the other tools to be usable:

``` python
from energy_tools.complex import EleComplex
```

See [Usage](#usage) below for more details.

### energy_factors

The `energy_factors` module includes functions to calculate yearly energy factors for special calculations. Currently, it includes the `utilisation_factor` and `loss_factor` functions.

### misc

The `misc` module includes basic functions to manipulate impedances, including `serie`, `parallel`, `zCap` and `zInd`. These calculate series impedance, parallel impedances, capacitance impedance and inductance impedance respectively.

### per_unit

The `per_unit` module includes functions that return the base current, impedance and power.

### phasor

The `phasor` module includes a new data type `Phasor` for the electrical phasor used in power systems.

A phasor is defined by an amplitude and a phase. The instance can be created either using those, or by providing a complex amplitude (in this case the phase is ignored). Several operations are supported, including: addition, substraction, multiplication, division, power, inversion and equality with either another phasor, a float or an integer.

It also provides a nice representation in this form: 120.000 @ 0.000Â°

Attributes:

- amp: The unitless phasor amplitude.
- pha: The phasor's phase in degrees.
- real: The phasor's real part (interpreted as a complex number).
- imag: The phasor's imaginary part (interpreted as a complex number).

The `phasor` module also includes functions `sequences` and `phasors`. The former retuns phase A's sequence voltages from phase A, B and C's voltages. The latter does the opposite, i.e. it returns phase A, B and C's voltages from phases A's sequence voltages.

### power

The `power` module includes 2 functions `p()` and `q()` which calculate the active power and reactive power based on at least 2 of the following arguments:

- `p`: Active power (for `q()`).
- `q`: Reactive power (for `p()`).
- `s`: Apparent power.
- `pf`: Power factor.

The arguments and return value are unitless.

## Usage

Sample usage may be found in the [tests](https://gitlab.com/miek770/energy_tools/tree/master/energy_tools/tests) directory. Most of these tools are straightforward (or aim to be), so the tests and docstrings should be helpful enough.

As mentioned [above](#complex), the `EleComplex` class must be imported in order for many of the other tools to be usable:

``` python
from energy_tools.complex import EleComplex
```

When the improved `EleComplex` type is imported this way, the following call will result in variable `a` being an `energy_tools.complex.EleComplex` instance, as expected:

```
a = EleComplex(1, 1)
a.phase #  Will return 45 degrees
```

Implicitly declaring a complex number, however, will return the built-in `complex` type:

```
a = 1 + 1j
a.phase #  Will raise AttributeError
```
