*sispca* is a Python package designed to learn linear representations capturing variations associated with factors of interest in high-dimensional data. It extends the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to multiple subspaces and encourage subspace disentanglement by maximizing the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The model is implemented in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and uses the [Lightning framework](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) for training. See the [documentation](https://sispca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details.

For more theoretical connections and applications, please refer to our paper [Disentangling Interpretable Factors of Variations with Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AFnSMlye5K).
