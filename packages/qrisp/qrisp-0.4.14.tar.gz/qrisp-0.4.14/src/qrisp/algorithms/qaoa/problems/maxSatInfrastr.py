def maxSatCostOp(problem):

    """
    Implementation for MaxSat Cost-Operator, in accordance to the original QAOA-paper.
    
    For each clause :math:`C_i` apply :math:`C_i(x) = 1 - \prod_j x_j` (replace :math:`x_j` with 
    :math:`(1-x_j)` if :math:`x_j` is negated). The problem operator is acquired with the substitution 
    :math:`x_j = (I - Z_j)` , where :math:`Z_j` is the Pauli- :math:`Z` operator applied to the :math:`j` -th qubit.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    clauses : List(Lists)
        Clauses to be considered for MaxSat. Should be given as a list of lists and 1-indexed instead 0-indexed, see example

        
    Returns
    -------
    QuantumCircuit: qrisp.QuantumCircuit
        the Operator applied to the circuit-QuantumVariable

    Examples
    --------
    >>> clauses11 = (6, [[1,2,-3], [1,4,-6], [4,5,6], [1,3,-4], [2,4,5], [1,3,5], [-2,-3,6]])
    
    |  Explanation: 
    |  First entry of tuple is the number of variables, second is the clauses
    |  Clause [1, 2, -4] is fulfilled by the QuantumStates "1100", "1110" 

    * if the sign is positive : the index has of the QuantumVariable to be "1", if negative sign the index has to be "0".
    * indices not mentioned can be "0" or "1" (the third integer in this case).
    * start with 1 in your clauses! because ``int 0`` has no sign and this is problematic. 
    * we want to keep the mathematical formulation, so no handing over strings!

    Assign the operators
