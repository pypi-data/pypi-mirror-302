Description:
-------------
This script implements the `Quota` class, designed to monitor and manage session time limits in cloud environments
like Kaggle or Colab with quota restrictions. It helps in tracking session time and takes action based on predefined
quota and buffer times (gap times). The class provides automatic adjustment of gap times based on average execution
time during operation.

Change Log:
-----------
v0.0.2 - Updated on Wed Oct 16, 2024
  - Introduced dynamic gap time (`auto` option) based on average execution times.
  - Added logging functionality to log remaining time.
  - Improved time validation to handle improper inputs.
  - Enhanced time format support, now allowing conversions from strings like '1h', '30m', '5s'.
  - Refactored internal code structure for readability.
  - Introduced automatic performance monitoring to calculate execution time per loop iteration.

v0.0.1 - Initial implementation (Tue May 11, 2021)
  - Basic `Quota` class to track remaining session time.
  - Static gap time support.
  - Basic time formatting and conversion.

Usage:
------
For usage examples, refer to the class-level docstring of `Quota`.

class Quota:
    """
    Monitors session time limits in cloud environments with quota limitations (e.g., Kaggle, Colab).

    This class allows users to set a quota time and a gap time, with options for automatic gap time adjustment
    based on the average execution time of operations within a loop. It can log remaining time and check if
    the time limits are reached.

    Time Format:
        The time format must be passed as a string combining digits and a single character representing the time unit:
        - 's' for seconds
        - 'm' for minutes
        - 'h' for hours
        - 'd' for days

        Examples:
        - '30s' for 30 seconds
        - '5m' for 5 minutes
        - '2h' for 2 hours
        - '1d' for 1 day

        If an invalid format is provided, a ValueError will be raised.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    - quota_time (str):
            Time quota for the session (e.g., '1h' for 1 hour, '30m' for 30 minutes).
            This is initially provided as a string and is internally converted to seconds.
            Default is '6h'.
    - gap_time (str):
            Time buffer before the quota ends to trigger actions.
            Set to 'auto' for automatic detection based on average execution time.
            Internally converted to seconds.
            Default is 'auto'.
    - enable_logging (bool, optional):
            Whether to enable logging or not. Default is False.

    Raises:
    -----------
    - ValueError:
            - If the `quota_time` or `gap_time` format is invalid. This occurs when the time strings are not formatted correctly
              (e.g., not containing valid time units like 's', 'm', 'h', 'd').
            - If the `quota_time` is less than or equal to zero. A quota time must be a positive value in seconds.
            - If the `gap_time` is greater than or equal to the `quota_time`. The gap time should be smaller than the quota time to make sense.
    - TypeError:
            - If a non-string value is provided for `quota_time` or `gap_time`. Both `quota_time` and `gap_time` must be strings to be processed.
    - AttributeError:
            - If an attempt is made to access properties or methods without proper initialization of internal values (such as accessing `execution_times` before an operation).

    Properties:
    -----------
    - start_time: The timestamp when the `Quota` instance is initialized (in seconds from `default_timer`).
    - quota_time: Total session quota time in seconds, converted from the input string (e.g., '1h' â†’ 3600).
    - auto_gap_time: Flag to indicate whether gap time is set to 'auto', allowing dynamic adjustment.
    - gap_time: The buffer time before the quota ends. Can be statically set (manual time in seconds) or dynamically adjusted if 'auto'.
    - enable_logging: Whether to log the remaining time to the console.
    - execution_times: List of execution times (in seconds) for each loop iteration, used to calculate average execution time.
    - total_execution_time: The sum of all execution times, used for calculating the dynamic gap time.
    - last_execution_time: Timestamp of the last completed loop iteration (in seconds).
