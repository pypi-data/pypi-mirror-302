def minSetCoverCostOp(sets, universe):
    """
    |  Create the cost/problem operator for this problem instance. Swapping rule is to swap a set in and out of the solution, if all elements are covered by other sets
    |  Idea - Per set: 

    * create ancillas for every element, they represent these elements
    * ancillas are set to "1" by default
    * perform multi controlled x operations on each ancilla
    * controls are given by sets with also contain the considered element
    * if all controls are "0" (see ``ctrl_state`` for ``mcx``-operation) we set this ancilla to "0"
    
    |  Then perform mcx on the qubit describing the set:
    |  If all ancillas are "1" this means that, for all elements in the list, there is already (atleast) one set in the bitstring describing the solution sets, which already contains this element. The set can then be swapped in (or out) of the solution, since all elements are covered by other sets
    |  Afterwards uncompute the ancillas

    Parameters
    ----------
    sets : list(Lists)
        The sets the universe is seperated into as by the problem definition

    universe: Tuple
        The universe for the problem instance, i.e. all possible values (all graph vertices)

    Returns
    -------
    QuantumCircuit: qrisp.QuantumCircuit
        the Operator applied to the circuit-QuantumVariable

    Examples
    --------

    Definition of the sets, given as list of lists. Full universe ``sol`` is given as a tuple
    >>> sets = [[0,7,1],[6,5],[2,3],[5,4],[8,7,0],[1]]
    >>> sol = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

    The relations between the sets, i.e. which vertice is in which other sets

    >>> print(get_neighbourhood_relations(sets, len_universe=len(sol)))

    Assign operators
    >>> cost_fun = minSetCoverclCostfct(sets=sets,universe = sol)
    >>> mixerOp = RZ_Mixer()
    >>> costOp = minSetCoverCostOp(sets=sets, universe=sol)
