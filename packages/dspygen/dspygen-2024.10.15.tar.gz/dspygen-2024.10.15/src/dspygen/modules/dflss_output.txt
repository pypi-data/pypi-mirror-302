1. System: Order Processing System with DSPy Integration
2. Benefits:
	* Structured data handling
	* Automatic state management
	* Enhanced debugging capabilities through systematic logging and validation
3. Project Scope:
	* Convert existing order processing methods and transitions into DSPy-compatible modules
	* Utilize DSPy's capabilities for handling different states of an order's lifecycle within a declarative pipeline environment
	* Implement validation and action triggers as modular components
	* Integrate state change triggers with conditions and actions based on DSPyâ€™s event-driven architecture
4. Implementation Plan and Guidelines:
	* Maintain all functionality within Python, ensuring no external system dependencies at this stage
