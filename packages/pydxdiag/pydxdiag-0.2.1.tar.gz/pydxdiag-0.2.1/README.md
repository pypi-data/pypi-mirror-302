# Pydxdiag - Python Parser & ORMs for dxdiag

Pydxdiag is a `praser` and `ORMs` for `dxdiag.exe` on Windows. Meaning you can access dxdiag information in your Python programs.

### To install

type below command in your favorite terminal.

```bash
pip install pydxdiag
```

or 

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ElinLiu0/pydxdiag
```

### Quick Start

Here you need to initialize a `DxDiagparser()` object like below.

```python
from pydxdiag.DxdiagParser import DxdiagParser
parser = DxdiagParser()
```

This will call a subprocess to run below command in background:

```powershell
dxdiag.exe -w output.xml
```

> Since dxdiag doesn't support directly output into terminal,so that we can only export it into xml format.

Once parser object has been initalized,you can try calling this code as below:

```python
parser.GetOSInformation()
```

If you get this:

```python
OSInformation(Name='Windows 11 专业版 64-bit (10.0, Build 22631) (22621.ni_release.220506-1250)', Version=11, Bit=64, BuildId=22631, ReleaseId='22621.ni_release.220506-1250', Language='Chinese (Simplified) (Regional Setting: Chinese (Simplified))')
```

That means all things is get ready for you,GLHF : )
