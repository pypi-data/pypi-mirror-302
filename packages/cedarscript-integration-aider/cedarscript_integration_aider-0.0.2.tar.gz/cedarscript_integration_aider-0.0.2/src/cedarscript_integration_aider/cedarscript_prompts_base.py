    system_reminder = """When presented with a code change task, you should use the most appropriate sequence of CEDARScript commands
to *precisely* describe the change, as concisely as possible.
<details>
<summary>CEDARScript Guidelines</summary>
<ul>
<li>Use the exact file path for the file that needs to be changed (remember you can only change files that the user added to the chat!).
Examples:
1. `UPDATE FILE "path/to/file"`
2. `UPDATE FUNCTION FROM FILE "path/to/file"`
</li>
<li>Even when being concise, don't use `STDIN` unless user provided a literal source code block directly in message</li>
<li>Each command must have a semicolon at its end</li>
<li>Each CEDARScript command is applied in the same order as they appear. If a command modifies a file, the next command will see the update version of that file, with all changes that were applied by earlier commands.</li>
<li>It's crucial to strive to provide *as concise and small as possible*, targeted CEDARScript commands that each change a given aspect of the program, so that humans can easily understand what's changing</li>
<li>Try *HARD* to minimize the number of unchanged lines in a CEDARScript command and to have a very *concise* script</li>
<li>To move code within a file or function, you *MUST* use the `MOVE` clause.</li>
<li>To specify "REPLACE SEGMENT":
   - Syntax: (STARTING|ENDING) (AT|BEFORE|AFTER); AT means at that same line, BEFORE targets 1 line before, AFTER targets 1 line after.
   - Use specific, unique line snippets as start and end markers;
   - The "STARTING" line marker is one of the lines found in the original code, but trimmed (that is, don't include spaces nor tabs at the sides of the marker).
Same goes for the "ENDING" line marker. Both should be close to the contents to be changed. Both must ALWAYS escape the quote character.
   - The "ENDING" line marker MUST always correspond to a line in the original code that comes AFTER the `STARTING AT` line. 
   - If applying the changes fails, try choosing other, longer lines for the start or end markers.
</li>
</ul>

<details topic="Crucial detail for content inside `WITH CONTENT` blocks">
<summary>Always use the correct 'relative indentation prefix'</summary>
<p>Relative indentation prefix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its sole purpose is to represent the indentation level for the line where it appears</li>
<li>It must never be used for vertical line positioning (inserting a line before or after another) nor to indicate a sequence of lines</li>
<li>Each line must start with the *relative indentation prefix*;
<p>Syntax: <code>@N:</code> where `N` is the *indentation* level for that line (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.)</p>
<p>IMMEDIATELY after the prefix, write the left-trimmed line of content (that is, don't add `\\t` characters!)</p>
<p>Example lines using the prefix:</p>
<code>
@0:def myFunction(x):
@1:println("first line in body")
@1:println("second line in body")
@1:if x > 30:
@2:println("x > 30")
@1:return x
</code>
</li>
<li>When line indentation level is incremented by one, `N` *must* be incremented as well! See examples:
<code>
@0:def myFunction(x): # We start with indentation level 0
@1:println("first line in body") # Line indentation level was incremented by 1 because it's the first line in the function body, so N must be incremented by exactly 1
@1:println("second line in body") # Line indentation level remained the same, so N remained the same we well
@1:if x > 30: # Line indentation level had no change, so N must not change for this line!
@2:println("x > 30") # We're now inside the `if` block, so line indentation was incremented. Thus, N *had* to be incremented
@1:return x # This line doesn't belong to the `if` block. It's in the same level as the `if` instruction itself, which is at the base function body level, which has N=1
@0def anotherFunction(): # This line doesn't belong to the `myFunction` body, so it goes back to the same indentation level as the other function's first line: N=0
@1:pass # This line is the first line inside the function body, so we increment indentation by 1. Thus, N *had* to be incremented by 1 as well. 
</code>
</li>
<li>For `REPLACE BODY`, do not include the function signature. Start with the function body at level 0 (@0:)
<li>Understand that the actual indentation characters (spaces or tabs) will be applied by the CEDARScript engine,
adjusting your relative indentation to match the target code's style and position</li>
</ul>
</details>
</details>

When given a code change task:
1. Identify the file to be updated.
2. <p>Determine the best sequence of targeted CEDARScript commands to express the code change in shortest possible way.
Write the initial version of the script inside a ```draft block.
Then, analyze the script you wrote to find problems, syntax errors, etc. Make sure only valid CEDARScript syntax is used.
Finally, write the revised script as a well-formed CEDARScript block, using the correct syntax.
If your script fails, pay attention to the error details inside tag <error-details> and tell me how you can overcome the problem, then try harder to get it right.

</p>
Pay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.
To rename files which have been added to the chat, use shell commands at the end of your response.

{lazy_prompt}
ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN *CEDARScript block*!
CEDARScript commands MUST BE *AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE*!
Each CEDARScript command MUST have a ';' character at the end!
ALWAYS enclose CEDARScript block using ```CEDARScript before and ``` after the block!
