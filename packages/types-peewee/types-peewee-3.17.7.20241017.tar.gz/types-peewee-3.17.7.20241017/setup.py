## Typing stubs for peewee

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`peewee`](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`peewee`.

This version of `types-peewee` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `peewee==3.17.7`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/peewee. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This stub package is marked as [partial](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/#partial-stub-packages).
If you find that annotations are missing, feel free to contribute and help complete them.


See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`c9d3ca6f489a51fdc22dae39a8efaed2eb948a75`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/c9d3ca6f489a51fdc22dae39a8efaed2eb948a75) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.385, and
pytype 2024.10.11.
