paces_calc
===============

paces to distances conversion, a command line tool.

The main use cases of the tool are:

- Converting a workout pace at a given distance to what it's splits will be at
some specified distances
- Comparing average race splits across different times at given distance in a readable format
- Converting paces from and to meters (m), miles (mi), and kilometers (km or k)

Installation
------------

To install the command line tool, run:

```shell
pip3 install paces_calc
```

The command line tool will be installed as `pace` to `bin` on
Linux (e.g. `/usr/bin`); or as `pace.exe` to `Scripts` in your
Python installation on Windows (e.g. `C:\Python39\Scripts\pace.exe`).

You may consider installing only for the current user:

```shell
pip3 install paces_calc --user
```

In this case the command line utility will be installed to
`~/.local/bin/pace` on Linux and to
`%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts\pace.exe` on Windows.

Usage
-----

From the command line, use the installed `pace` script:

```shell
pace 4:12 -a 1600m -t 200m 400m 800m
```

Shorthand for the above operation would be:

```shell
pace 4:12 1600m 200m 400m 800m
```

use `pace -h` or `pace --help` for the quick help output, or use `pace man` for the full **man page** of the utility.

    usage: pace [-h] [-v] [-g] [-a DISTANCE] [-t [DISTANCE ...]] [pace ...]

    Easy pace conversion from the command line. When stdin is 'pace' (H:M:S or M:S or S), considered mile pace, and paces (400m, distance) at other
    distances are put to stdout.

    positional arguments:
    pace               The initial pace, so 0:6:12 is 0 hourse, 6 minutes, and 12 seconds

    options:
    -h, --help         show this help message and exit
    -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
    -g, --gui          open window application for pace distance conversions outside of command line
    -a, --at DISTANCE  specify the distance pace is at (i.e. 1600m)
    -t, --to DISTANCE  specify to what distance(s) you are converting to (i.e. 200m 400m 1mi)

Subtleties
----------

When `pace` is used shorthand style (without options -a or -t), only the first argument given is taken as the given pace, teh second argument is the distance that pace was run at, and the rest of the arguments are treated as the distances to convert to:

- `pace 12:14 -a 2mi -t 400m 800m 1km` is equivalent to `pace 12:14 2mi 400m 800m 1km`

When no distance unit is included with a distance value, the distance is considered to have been given in meters:

- `pace 4:16 -a 1600 -t 400 800` is treated as `pace 4:16 -a 1600m -t 400m 800m`

Using options instead of shorthand allows for multiple paces to be given as the starting parameter before -a, meaning different converted paces can be compared.  Each starting pace to convert will be a seperate column in the printed out table:

- `pace 27:05 26:43 26:15 -a 8km -t 400m 1mi 3km 5km 10km` Will produce 3 columns for 27:05, 26:43, and 26:15, with the rows holding the conversions for each of these 8km times to the given -t distances

calc is short for calculator by the way, it's slang

Examples
--------

Default usage:
- `pace 5:22`

Multiple 8km race times and their avergae splits at specified distances:
- `pace 27:05 26:30 26:05 25:45 -a 8km -t 400m 1mi 2mi 5km 10km`

A 5 minute 12 second 1600m workout time and the splits to hit it:
- `pace 5:12 1600m 200m 400m 800m`

Elian Kipchoge's 2022 Berlin marathon time compared to a 2:36:42 time:
-  `pace 2:01:09 2:36:42 -a 26.2mi -t 400m 5km 8km 13.1mi`
