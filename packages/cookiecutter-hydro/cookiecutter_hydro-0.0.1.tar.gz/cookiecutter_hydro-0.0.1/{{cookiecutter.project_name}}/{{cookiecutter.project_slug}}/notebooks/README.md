# Jupyter notebooks

My favourite way to work on data hydrological models is to use jupyter notebooks. They give an amazing platform to build the models and document them at the same time. It is also good to split the workflows into multiple notebooks to avoid creating monstrous, unreadable files. As pointed out in [this article](https://www.svds.com/jupyter-notebook-best-practices-for-data-science/), it is also increadibly important to keep a consistent way of naming your notebooks. This structure makes a lot of sense:

[ISO 8601 date]-[DS-initials]-[2-4 word description].ipynb

e.g.: 2015-06-28-jw-initial-data-clean.ipynb

This allows you to search for notebooks by date or topic.
