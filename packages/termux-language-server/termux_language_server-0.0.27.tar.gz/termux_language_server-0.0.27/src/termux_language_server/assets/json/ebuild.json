This has the added convenience of eliminating the need to specify \"${ROOT%/}\" when concatenating paths, making the use of ROOT more elegant. This applies to the variables EROOT, D and ED as well. Please make note that this will mean that ebuilds must use different logic in conditionals to determine if they are installing to the root filesystem -- use [[ \"$ROOT\" == \"\" ]] instead of [[ \"$ROOT\" == \"/\" ]].",

For maximum backward compatiblity, a package should conform to the lowest possible EAPI.
