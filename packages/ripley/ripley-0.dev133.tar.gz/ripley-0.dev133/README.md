# Ripley

At one point in my life, I had many routine tasks related to various data manipulations and database structures. 
These tasks were related to recalculations, one time data transfers / scripting / pipelines, legacy, research, 
analytics etc. I started this package just for fun. Maybe it will be useful to someone.

Ripley provides a simple interface for routine data operations. The main idea:

- no dependencies
- no error handlers
- no package errors
- no loggers 
- isolation from the database driver
