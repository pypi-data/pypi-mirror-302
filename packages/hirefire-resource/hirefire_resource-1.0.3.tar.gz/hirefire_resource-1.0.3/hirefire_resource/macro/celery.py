def job_queue_latency(*queues, broker_url=None):
    """
    Calculates the maximum job queue latency across the specified queues using Celery with either
    Redis or RabbitMQ (AMQP) as the broker.

    This function dynamically selects the broker based on the provided broker_url, environment
    variables, or falls back to a default local broker URL. If RabbitMQ (AMQP) is available, it is
    preferred; otherwise, Redis is used.

    Note:
        - Due to Celery's architecture, it is not possible to measure job queue latency with 100%
          accuracy. This function attempts to measure latency as accurately as possible, but there
          are some caveats. See the remaining notes for more details.
        - The `run_at` header is added to each task at publish time using a Celery signal. This
          signal is automatically registered when importing this module, so ensure that every Python
          process that enqueues tasks imports this module.
        - Job queue latency is measured by inspecting the `run_at` header of the next job in the
          queue. For Redis, this works fine, as the queue can be inspected without mutation. For
          RabbitMQ, however, this involves consuming a task, and then rejecting and requeuing it.
          This will occasionally lead to out-of-order execution for certain tasks. However, if
          autoscaling is working effectively, this should not be a significant issue.
        - It is recommended to avoid using the eta and countdown options for tasks in queues that
          are being autoscaled. Tasks with an eta (scheduled tasks) are placed in the same queue as
          regular tasks and maintain the FIFO order, which interferes with job queue latency
          measurement.
        - Failed tasks that are to be retried are published with an eta. While not ideal, occasional
          scheduled tasks, which are typically rare, generally aren't an issue.
        - If you absolutely require the ability to schedule tasks to run in the future, consider
          using a workaround, such as a separate queue for scheduled tasks that forwards tasks ready
          to run to the relevant regular queues. Just remember that the `run_at` header is required.

    Args:
        *queues (str): Names of the queues for latency measurement.
        broker_url (str, optional): The broker URL. Defaults in the following order:
