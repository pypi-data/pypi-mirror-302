## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use the `whisper` command in your terminal to interact with the CLI tool.

### General Command Format

The basic format for using the Whisper CLI is:
```bash

```

Each command has specific options and flags as described below.

### Signup

### Login
To log into the application:

After running this command, you will be prompted to enter whether you're ready to chat:
