## Introduction

DSPyGen, influenced by the pioneering work of Sean Chatman and James I. Chatman, embodies a structured approach to AI development. This tool is designed to streamline your workflow, enhance productivity, and ensure you stay ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.

## Features

- **Quick Initialization**: Set up your DSPyGen project in seconds, echoing the ease of starting new projects with Ruby on Rails.
- **Modular Approach**: Inspired by Ruby on Rails' modular design, DSPyGen allows for the easy generation and enhancement of DSPy modules.
- **Intuitive Command Structure**: Manage your AI development workflow with straightforward commands.


### Quick Start

Initialize a new DSPyGen project:
```bash
dspygen init my_project
cd my_project
```

Generate a new module:
```bash
dspygen module new -cn TextSummarizer -i "text" -o "summary"
```

Run the module:
```bash
dspygen module text_summarizer call "Gettysburg address" 
```

Serve the REST API:
```bash
docker-compose up app
```

## Module Creation

The `dspygen module new` command is the cornerstone of DSPyGen, enabling users to create new modules efficiently. This section highlights the usage and provides common use cases for language models.

### Usage

```bash
dspygen module new [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--class-name, -cn TEXT`: The name of the module class (required).
- `--inputs, -i TEXT`: A comma-separated list of input names.
- `--output, -o TEXT`: Output name for the module.
- `--help`: Show this message and exit.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Text Summarization**:
    ```bash
    dspygen module new -cn TextSummarizer -i "text" -o "summary"
    ```

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
    ```bash
    dspygen module new -cn SentimentAnalyzer -i "text" -o "sentiment"
    ```

3. **YouTube Comment Generation**:
    ```bash
    dspygen module new -cn Comment -i "vid_title,words" -o "viral_comment"
    ```

4. **Machine Translation**:
    ```bash
    dspygen module new -cn Translator -i "source_text,target_language" -o "translated_text"
    ```

5. **Code Generation**:
    ```bash
    dspygen module new -cn CodeGenerator -i "prompt" -o "generated_code"
    ```
   
### Getting Started

**Using OpenAI**:
```python
from dspygen.utils.dspy_tools import init_dspy
from dspygen.modules.text_summarizer_module import text_summarizer_call


init_dspy(model="gpt-4o", max_tokens=500)
text_summarizer_call("Gettysburg address") 
```


**Using Groq**:
Obtain your API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys) and modify your `.env` file as demonstrated in `.envDemo`. Don't forget to initialize:

```python
from dspygen.utils.dspy_tools import init_dspy
from dspygen.lm.groq_lm import Groq
from dspygen.modules.text_summarizer_module import text_summarizer_call


init_dspy(model="llama3-70b-8192", lm_class=Groq, max_tokens=8000)
text_summarizer_call("Gettysburg address")
```

**Privacy and Data Protection**:
For privacy and data loss protection, we recommend initializing DSPyGen with Ollama.

**Install Ollama**:
   Visit [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to install the necessary tools.

```python
from dspygen.utils.dspy_tools import init_ol
from dspygen.modules.text_summarizer_module import text_summarizer_call

init_ol(model="llama3", max_tokens=2000)

text_summarizer_call("Gettysburg address")
```

By following these steps, you can integrate the concept of structured commodities into your code generation workflow, ensuring compliance and fair compensation for creators.



By understanding and utilizing the `dspygen module new` command, you can harness the full potential of DSPyGen to create powerful and flexible AI development workflows.

### Production Module

The following example demonstrates a production module that generates a mock Pytest module for a given Python source code. This module is designed to create comprehensive and robust mock tests that simulate possible unit tests based on the functions and methods defined within the source code.

```python
import dspy

class GenerateMockPytest(dspy.Signature):
    """
    Generates a mocked pytest module for the provided Python source code.
    This class aims to create comprehensive and robust mock tests that simulate
    possible unit tests based on the functions and methods defined within the source code.
    Write the test like a FAANG Python architect at Meta.
    Only reply within ```python``` block. All other text needs to be in docstrings or comments.
    """
    source_code = dspy.InputField(desc="Python source code for which to generate a mock test.")
    mocked_pytest = dspy.OutputField(desc="Generated mock pytest code. Within triple backticks", 
                                     prefix="```python\n")

class PytestModule(dspy.Module):
    """PytestModule"""

    def __init__(self, **forward_args):
        super().__init__()
        self.forward_args = forward_args
        self.output = None

    def forward(self, source_code):
        pred = dspy.Predict(GenerateMockPytest)
        self.output = pred(source_code=source_code).mocked_pytest
        return self.output

def pytest_call(source_code):
    pytest = PytestModule()
    return pytest.forward(source_code=source_code)

example_code = """def fetch_user_name(user_id):
    import requests
    response = requests.get(f'https://api.example.com/users/{user_id}')
    return response.json()['name']
"""

def main():
    from dspygen.utils.dspy_tools import init_ol
    lm = init_ol()
    source_code = example_code
    result = pytest_call(source_code=source_code)
    from dspygen.utils.file_tools import extract_code
    print(extract_code(result))
    print(lm.inspect_history(n=1))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Example: Generated Pytest Module (Continued)
```python
import pytest
from your_module import fetch_user_name

@pytest.fixture
def mocker():
    return pytest.mockito()

def test_fetch_user_name(mocker):
    mocked_requests_get = mocker.patch('requests.get')
    response_json = {'name': 'John Doe'}
    mocked_requests_get.return_value.json.return_value = response_json
    
    result = fetch_user_name(123)
    assert result == 'John Doe'
    
    # Verify that the requests.get call was not made
    assert not mocked_requests_get.called
```

## Structuring Code: A New Class of Digital Assets

### Dematerialized Commodity Concept

Inspired by financial engineering and the structuring of financial products, we aim to bring the same level of compliance and innovation to code generation systems. In today's AI-driven world, it is crucial to ensure that creators of valuable, new code receive appropriate compensation whenever their code is analyzed, cloned, or used, especially at the enterprise level.

### NFTs as Structured Commodities

The foundation for all valuable, useful code should be a new form of NFT â€“ a structured commodity of code. This concept is akin to a dematerialized asset, similar to the Meta-Bricks repository we previously created. This would involve a massive store of runnable and easily pluggable/composable elements of code, paired with terms and conditions familiar from classical structured products (e.g., Ricardian Contracts).

### Legal Compliance and Revenue Sharing

To minimize legal risks and ensure proper compensation, retrievers should use these structured commodities for code generation workflows. They should always send payments or share revenues from new creations derived from these meta-bricks to the original creators. While many current LLMs do not reference the source of the code, this is an area that can and should be improved.
