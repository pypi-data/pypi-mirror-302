class BaseTask:
    """Outlines the structure for tasks, which are discrete units of logic executed as part of the
    system's operations. Tasks encapsulate specific behaviors or processes, such as validation, computation,
    or state transitions, facilitating modularity and reuse. By defining tasks as subclasses of AbstractTask,
    the system can orchestrate complex operations while maintaining clarity and separation of concerns.
