    |  Create the cost/problem operator for this problem instance. The swapping rule is to swap a set in and out of the solution, if it is not intersecting with any other set.
    |  Idea - Per set: 

    * Create ancillas for every element, they represent these elements
    * Perform multi controlled x operations on each ancilla
    * Controls are given by sets with also contain the considered element
    * If all controls are "0" (see ``ctrl_state`` for ``mcx``-operation) we set this ancilla to "1"

    |  Then perform mcx on the qubit describing the set as follows:
    |  If all ancillas are "1" this means the qubits describing the sets contain no intersections with the considered set. We can then swap the set in (or out).
    |  Afterwards uncompute the ancillas.
