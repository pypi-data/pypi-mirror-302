# OpenSSL 3.3+ includes a patch[1] for s390x architecture that uses a
# specialized instruction (cijne), which is not recognized by GCC in
# ghcr.io/rust-cross/manylinux2014-cross:s390x, and thus fails to
# compile in CI.
#
# Pin "openssl-src" to 300.2.x, which will install openssl-3.2.x,
# which didn't use cijne.
