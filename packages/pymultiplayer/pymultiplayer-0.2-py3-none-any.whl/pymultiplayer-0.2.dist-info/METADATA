# pymultiplayer
A package for adding multiplayer functionality to games.

# Installation
`pip install pymultiplayer` or `python -m pip install multiplayer`

# Notes
This is a work in progress. Don't expect all features to work.
I don't know what version of python is needed for this package to work.
I will figure this stuff out in due course.

This is mainly just a passion project/project to help future projects (in fact I'm using it right now in [Elemental Defense](https://www.github.com/iamdeedz/elemental-defense/)) but it would be nice if it had some use.
