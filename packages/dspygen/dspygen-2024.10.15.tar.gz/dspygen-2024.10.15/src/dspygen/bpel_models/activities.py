activities.py

This module defines Pydantic models for WS-BPEL 2.0 activities. Activities are the fundamental building blocks of BPEL processes,
defining the business logic and the sequence of operations that are executed within a process.

Included models:
- InvokeActivity: Represents an activity to invoke an operation on a partner Web service.
- ReceiveActivity: Represents an activity that waits for a message from an external partner.
- AssignActivity: Represents an activity for assigning values to variables within the process.
- WaitActivity: Represents an activity that pauses the process execution for a specified duration.
- SequenceActivity: Represents a structured activity that executes a series of activities in a sequential order.
- FlowActivity: Represents a structured activity that allows for concurrent execution of activities.
- PickActivity: Represents a structured activity that waits for one out of several possible events to occur.
- IfActivity: Represents a structured activity that executes one set of activities if a condition is true, and another set if false.
- WhileActivity: Represents a structured activity that repeatedly executes a set of activities while a condition is true.
- RepeatUntilActivity: Represents a structured activity that repeatedly executes a set of activities until a condition becomes true.
- CompensateActivity: Represents an activity that triggers compensation logic for previously executed activities within a scope.
- ThrowActivity: Represents an activity that explicitly throws a fault, causing the process to terminate with a faulted state.
- TerminateActivity: Represents an activity that abruptly terminates the process instance.
- ValidateActivity: Represents an activity that performs validation on a specified variable or data.
- RethrowActivity: Represents an activity that rethrows a caught fault, propagating it to the parent scope for handling.
- CompensateScopeActivity: Represents an activity that triggers compensation logic for the entire scope in which it is defined.
- EmptyActivity: Represents an empty activity, which has no effect on the process execution.
- ScopeActivity: Represents a scoped group of activities with its own local context, including variables, fault handlers, and more.
- ForLoopActivity: Represents a loop activity with a defined start, end, and increment, iterating over a block of activities.
