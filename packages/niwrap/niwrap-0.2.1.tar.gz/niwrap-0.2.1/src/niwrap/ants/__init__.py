ANTs

Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) is a C++ library available through the
command line that computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics
of brain structure and function. It allows one to organize, visualize and
statistically explore large biomedical image sets. Additionally, it integrates
imaging modalities in space + time and works across species or organ systems
with minimal customization.

The ANTs library is considered a state-of-the-art medical image registration and
segmentation toolkit which depends on the Insight ToolKit, a widely used medical
image processing library to which ANTs developers contribute. ANTs-related tools
have also won several international, unbiased competitions such as MICCAI,
BRATS, and STACOM.
