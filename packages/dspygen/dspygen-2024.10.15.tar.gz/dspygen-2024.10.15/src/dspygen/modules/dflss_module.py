Business Case:
The current order processing system, implemented via a finite state machine, is functional but lacks the flexibility and modularity needed for easy scalability and maintenance. By integrating DSPy, the system can benefit from more structured data handling, automatic state management, and enhanced debugging capabilities through systematic logging and validation.

Project Scope:
Convert existing order processing methods and transitions into DSPy-compatible dspy_modules.
Use DSPy's capabilities to handle different states of an order's lifecycle within a declarative pipeline environments.
Implement validation and action triggers as modular components.
Integrate state change triggers with conditions and actions based on DSPy’s event-driven architecture.
Maintain all functionality within Python, ensuring no external system dependencies at this stage.
