Installation
------------

To install the XNAT_CLI_Toolkit, use the following command:

::

    pip install XNAT_CLI_Toolkit

Once installed, you can start using the command-line tool by typing ``xnat-toolkit`` in your terminal.


Authentication Module
---------------------

The ``authenticate.py`` module is responsible for securely handling user credentials. It stores credentials for the XNAT server, reuses sessions, and manages credential expiration.
Below is a detailed description of how the authentication process works and the options available.

Authentication Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``authenticate.py`` module offers functionality for securely storing and retrieving XNAT server credentials. 
This ensures that you don't need to re-enter your credentials for every command, making the interaction more efficient.

Command for Storing Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To store your XNAT credentials (host, username, password), use the following command:

::

    xnat-authenticate --host <XNAT_SERVER_URL> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>

This command saves your credentials securely to your ``.netrc`` file and stores a timestamp for session tracking.

Key Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``store_credentials(host, username, password):``
    - Saves the host and user credentials to the .netrc file.

    - Stores a timestamp for the credentials in a JSON file (``~/.last_credentials.json``), allowing the system to verify the session validity.

- ``get_credentials():``
    - Retrieves the last stored credentials from the JSON file.

    - Checks if the credentials have expired. If the session has expired (after 30 minutes), it prompts the user to re-enter their credentials.

Handling Expired Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When credentials are older than the expiration time (60 minutes), the system will prompt you to enter new ones. If an attempt is made to access XNAT with expired credentials, the following exception will be raised:

::

    CredentialExpiredError: "Credentials have expired. Please enter new ones through xnat-authenticate."

Project Listing Module
-----------------------

The ``list.py`` module provides functionality to list the available projects on the XNAT server. 
This command uses the ``click`` package to create a command-line interface that connects to the server, fetches a list of projects, and displays them. 
If credentials (server URL, username, and password) are not provided via the command-line, it retrieves them from previously stored credentials using the ``authenticate.py`` module.

Command for Listing Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``xnat-list`` command fetches and displays the list of projects stored on the XNAT server. 
If credentials are not passed in via the command-line options, the stored credentials from ``.netrc`` or the last credentials JSON file are used.

Usage
~~~~~
To list all the projects available on your XNAT server, use the following command:

::

    xnat-list --server <XNAT_SERVER_URL> --username <USERNAME> --password <PASSWORD>

If you have already stored your credentials using the ``xnat-authenticate`` command, you can omit the server, username, and password, and the tool will automatically fetch the saved credentials:

::

    xnat-list

This will securely retrieve your credentials from the stored ``.netrc`` file and connect to the XNAT server.

Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Command-line options: The ``xnat-list`` command supports passing in the server URL, username, and password directly via the command line.
    - ``--server`` or ``-s``: The XNAT server URL (e.g., ``http://localhost``).

    - ``--username`` or ``-u``: The username for the XNAT server.

    - ``--password`` or ``-p``: The password for the XNAT server. If not provided, credentials will be fetched from stored values.

- Logging:
    - Logs are created in the ``logs`` folder in the current working directory.

    - The log filename is generated using the current date and time, ensuring that each session has its own log file. The log captures important events such as connecting to the server, fetching projects, and errors if any occur during the process.

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the connection to the **XNAT** server fails, or if there is an issue with the provided credentials, an appropriate error message is displayed. Errors and exceptions are also logged into the log file for future reference.

Example
~~~~~~~
Here's an example of listing projects from the XNAT server without passing credentials (assuming they have been previously stored):

::

    $ xnat-list
    Using credentials from .netrc...
    server: http://xnat.example.com, Username: myuser
    Project ID: Project1
    Project ID: Project2
    ...

In case of a failure in connecting to the server or retrieving projects, the error will be logged, and an error message will be printed to the console:

::

    $ xnat-list
    Error: Failed to connect to the XNAT server.

Logging Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Upon execution, logs are generated with timestamps for every action performed, for example:

::

    2024-10-15 13:45:22 - INFO - Using credentials from .netrc.
    2024-10-15 13:45:24 - INFO - Fetched projects from the XNAT server.
    2024-10-15 13:45:27 - ERROR - Error: Connection refused.

File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``xnat-list``: Command to list projects from the XNAT server.

- Logging: Stored in a log file under the ``logs`` directory with a timestamp in the filename.

- Error Handling: Includes error messages for failed connections and logs them.

Upload and Archive Module
-------------------------

The ``upload.py`` module provides a command-line interface to upload DICOM files to an XNAT project, archive the uploaded files, and update demographic information for the subjects. The module uses the ``click`` package for argument parsing and ``xnat`` for connecting and interacting with the XNAT server.

Command for Uploading and Archiving Files
The ``xnat-upload`` command uploads ZIP files containing DICOM data to the XNAT server's prearchive, archives them into the specified project, and updates subject demographic information.

Usage
~~~~~

To upload and archive DICOM files, use the following command:

::

    xnat-upload --project <XNAT_PROJECT> --server <XNAT_SERVER_URL> --username <USERNAME> --source <SOURCE_DIR>

If you have previously stored your credentials (server, username, and password), you can omit the credentials from the command, and they will be fetched from the stored credentials:

::

    xnat-upload --project <XNAT_PROJECT> --source <SOURCE_DIR>

The ``<SOURCE_DIR>`` should contain ZIP files of the DICOM datasets to be uploaded.

Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``--project`` or ``-d``: The XNAT project where the files will be archived. This option is required.

- ``--username`` or ``-u``: Username for XNAT. If not provided, the stored username is used.

- ``--server`` or ``-s``: The XNAT server URL (e.g., ``http://localhost``). If not provided, the stored server URL is used.

- ``--password`` or ``-p``: Password for XNAT. If not provided, the stored password is used.

- ``--source`` or ``-x``: Directory containing the ZIP files to be uploaded. This option is required.

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

1. **Credential Retrieval**: 
    - If username, server, or password is not provided, the ``get_credentials`` function from the ``authenticate.py`` module retrieves the stored credentials.

2. **File Upload**: 
    - The module traverses the specified source directory and uploads all ZIP files to the XNAT prearchive.

3. **Archiving Files**:
    - Once the files are uploaded, they are archived into the specified XNAT project, and an experiment label is generated based on subject, study date, study time, and modality.

4. **Demographic Update**: 
    - After archiving, the subject demographic variables such as age, date of birth (DOB), and gender are updated using DICOM tags if available.

Logging
~~~~~~~

Logs are created in the logs folder in the current working directory. The log file is named based on the current date and time, e.g., ``2024-10-15_13-45-22_share.log``.

Example log entry:

::

    2024-10-15 13:45:22 - INFO - Connected to XNAT http://xnat.example.com
    2024-10-15 13:45:24 - INFO - Uploading /path/to/file.zip
    2024-10-15 13:45:27 - ERROR - Error uploading /path/to/file.zip: Connection refused.

Example
~~~~~~~
Here's an example of uploading and archiving DICOM files to an XNAT project:

::

    $ xnat-upload --project MyProject --source /path/to/zip/files
    Using credentials from .netrc...
    Connected to XNAT http://xnat.example.com
    Uploading /path/to/file1.zip
    Uploading /path/to/file2.zip
    ...
