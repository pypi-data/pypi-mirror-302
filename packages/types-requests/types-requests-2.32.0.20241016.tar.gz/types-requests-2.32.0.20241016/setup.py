## Typing stubs for requests

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`requests`](https://github.com/psf/requests) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`requests`.

This version of `types-requests` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `requests==2.32.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/requests. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Note: `types-requests` has required `urllib3>=2` since v2.31.0.7. If you need to install `types-requests` into an environment that must also have `urllib3<2` installed into it, you will have to use `types-requests<2.31.0.7`.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit
[`ab8e0e1ca15b520cc2831ea54b3f9512ce2a234f`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/ab8e0e1ca15b520cc2831ea54b3f9512ce2a234f) and was tested
with mypy 1.11.2, pyright 1.1.383, and
pytype 2024.10.11.
