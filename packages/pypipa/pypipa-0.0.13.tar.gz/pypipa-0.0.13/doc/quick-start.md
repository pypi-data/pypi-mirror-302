# Quick Start

This document takes you through the basics of using pipa by measuring the performance of the perf bench as an example.

## Installation

Use the following command to install the package:

```shell
pip install pypipa
```

## Data Collection

First of all, use command `pipa generate`

```sh
❯ pipa generate
? Please select the way of workload you want to run. Build a script that collects performance data and start the workloa
d by perf.
? Where do you want to store your data? (Default: ./)
 ./data
? What's the frequency of perf-record? (Default: 999)
 999
? What's the event of perf-record? (Default: {cycles,instructions}:S)
 {cycles,instructions}:S
? Whether to use perf-annotate?
 No
? Do you want to use perf-stat or emon?
 perf-stat
? What's count deltas of perf-stat? (Default: 1000 milliseconds)
 1000
? What's the event of perf-stat?
 cycles,instructions,branch-misses,L1-dcache-load-misses,L1-icache-load-misses
? Whether to use taskset?
 Yes
? Which cores do you want to use? (Default: 0-47)
 0-47
? What's the command of workload?
 perf bench futex hash
Shell script generated successfully.
Please check the script in ./data/pipa-run.sh
Note that you may need to modify the script to meet your requirements. The core list is generated according to the
machine which runs this script now. pipa-run.sh is more suitable for reproducible workloads such as benchmark.
```

In this example, we use the `perf bench futex hash` as the observed workload, which is a micro benchmark that comes with perf. As long as perf is installed successfully, you don't need to install any dependencies to run this example.

If all goes well, you will get the following script, in the `data/pipa-run.sh`.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# The script generated by PIPA-TREE is used to collect performance data.
# Please check whether it meets expectations before running.

# Check if sar and perf are available
if ! command -v sar &> /dev/null; then
echo "sar command not found. Please install sar."
exit 1

if ! command -v perf &> /dev/null; then
echo "perf command not found. Please install perf."
exit 1

This script will run the workload twice, using `perf record` and` perf stat` + `sar` to make observations and save the corresponding data. In addition, before running, the process data will be checked to determine the noise level, and after running, the system configuration file will be exported.

After the running script is built, you can run it and redirect the results to a file.

```shell
bash ./data/pipa-run.sh > ./data/pipa-run.log
```

## Data Loading & Visualization

Before running the following data loading and visualization steps, we recommend that you configure your Python and Jupyter notebook environments.

```py
from pipa.service.pipashu import PIPAShuData

pipashu = PIPAShuData(
    perf_stat_path="./data/perf-stat.csv",
    sar_path="./data/sar.txt",
    perf_record_path="./data/perf.script",
)
```

We can find the following output information in pipa-run.log.

```bash

Averaged 2676646 operations/sec (+- 0.09%), total secs = 10
```

After summing the above throughput and multiplying the time (10 seconds), we can calculate the total number of transactions, which is 1284790070.


After that, we can use pipa's data based on perf-stat and sar to calculate some general metrics, covering CPU, memory, and disk.

```py
pipashu.get_metrics(num_transcations = 1284790070, threads = list(range(48)))
```

It is worth noting that by default, if no disk is specified, the disk with the highest utilization will be selected. The best practice is for users to identify which disk they are using before running the experiment and pass it here as a parameter.

```py
def get_metrics(
    num_transcations: int,
    threads: list,
    run_time: int = None,
    dev: str | None = None,
    freq_MHz: int = None
):
    pass
```
