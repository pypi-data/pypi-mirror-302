    "When you run `RayPipeline` under the hood it creates [ray actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html) for each component in the pipeline (`ComponentActor` instances). \n",
    "`ComponentActor` exposes `run_component` method which can be remotely executed by `RayPipelineProcessor` - another actor which orchestrates pipeline execution logic (e.g. runs components according to the order defined by pipeline connections). Lifetime of Haystack component instance is same as actor's. Please notice each Haystack component might have its own logic which could be not idempotent - we can not control it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case Haystack component requires `warm_up` - it will perform it during component's first run (first time `run_component` is called). Sometimes `warm_up` might be an expensive operation and ideally we would like to avoid it when we call `run_component` again. Internally ComponentActor will store a flag in case component has already been warmed up so that next time it runs we skip this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, whenever you run pipeline with `pipeline.run` the following happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pipeline is validated for correctness, along with given inputs if any\n",
    "2. `RayPipelineProcessor` actor is created\n",
    "3. `ComponentActor` is created for each component in pipeline\n",
    "4. `RayPipelineProcessor` starts pipeline execution\n",
    "5. When pipeline execution finishes all actors will be destroyed by default. Next time you call `pipeline.run` steps will be repeated, so **actor instances will be re-created**. "
