# ezmsg-vispy

`ezmsg-vispy` is an extension to the [`ezmsg`](https://github.com/iscoe/ezmsg)
framework, crafted to enhance and expedite the development
of real-time data visualizations. By leveraging the power of Qt and the Vispy plotting
library, `ezmsg-vispy` offers a fluid interface for high-performance
visualizations within systems developed with `ezmsg`.
It's an ideal tool for researchers and developers who require rapid prototyping
of graphical interfaces for complex datasets. With `ezmsg-vispy`, creating
interactive visualizations that can integrate seamlessly into message-driven
architectures is more intuitive than ever.

## Installation

To install `ezmsg-vispy`, simply run:

```bash
pip install ezmsg-vispy
```
