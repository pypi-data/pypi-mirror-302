"""Foreign function interface module.

Depending on the build-system (particularly pip version), the compiled extension
_matscipy.<cpython>.so may be installed in site-packages/ or in matscipy/, with
the latter being the intended destination. This module abstracts away the
import of symbols from the extension.

Example usage:
--------------

>>> from .ffi import first_neighbours  # imports a function from extension
>>> from . import ffi   # import as module
