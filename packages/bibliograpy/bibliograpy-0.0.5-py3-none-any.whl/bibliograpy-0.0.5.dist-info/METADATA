## API

The Bibliograpy API allows to manage bibliographic centralized references using decorators.

Hence, is it possible to factorize all bibliographic sources as variables in a single module, using them as arguments of
decorators.

```py
"""The bibliography module."""

from bibliograpy.api import TechReport

IAU_2006_B1 = TechReport.standard(
    cite_key='iau_2006_b1',
    author='',
    institution='iau',
    title='Adoption of the P03 Precession Theory and Definition of the Ecliptic',
    year=2006)
```

```py
"""The bibliography_client module using the bibliography.py module."""

from bibliograpy.api import reference

from bibliography import IAU_2006_B1

@reference(IAU_2006_B1)
def my_function():
    """My my_function documentation."""
    # some implementation here using the reference given as a parameter to the decorator

```

The usage of the decorator has two purposes.

First, to use a bibliographic reference defined once and for all, centralized and reusable.

Second, to implicitly add to the documentation of the decorated entity a bibliographical section.

```
import bibliography_client

>>> help(my_function)
Help on function my_function in module bibliography_client

my_function()
    My my_function documentation.

    Bibliography: Adoption of the P03 Precession Theory and Definition of the Ecliptic [iau_2006_b1]
```

## Preprocessing tool

Bibliograpy allows generating a source code bibliograpy from a resource bibliography file.

Bibliograpy process supports bibliography files in yaml format. Each bibliographic entry contains three fields. 
The `type` field only supports the `misc` value. The `key` fields represents the bibliographic entry unique key (id).
The `title` field represents the readable form or the entry. For instance:

```yml
- entry_type: misc
  cite_key: nasa
  title: NASA
- entry_type: misc
  cite_key: iau
  title: International Astronomical Union
```

This bibliography file can be preprocessend by the `bibliograpy process` tool.

```
bibliograpy process
```

This preprocessing produces the corresponding bibliographic references that can be used as
bibliograpy decorator arguments.

```py
from bibliograpy.api import Misc

NASA = Misc.standard(cite_key='nasa',
                     title='NASA')

IAU = Misc.standard(cite_key='iau',
                    title='International Astronomical Union')
```
