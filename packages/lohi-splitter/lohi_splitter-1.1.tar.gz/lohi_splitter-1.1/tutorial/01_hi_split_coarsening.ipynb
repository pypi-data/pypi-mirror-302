We'll delve into its execution shortly, but first, let's discuss another method to expedite the splitting process.\n",

    "Internally, the Hi splitter employs an optimization routine that maximizes a score function. While it quickly identifies a non-optimal solution, the algorithm might spend significant time improving it. If achieving the absolute optimal solution isn't mandatory for your use case, you can leverage early stopping. This approach halts the optimization once the difference between the current score and the theoretical optimum is sufficiently small. This is determined using the `max_mip_gap` parameter. When the fraction (score - optimum) / optimum drops below the `max_mip_gap` value, the optimization ceases. By default, this parameter is set to 0.1. However, if you prefer a quicker yet possibly less precise solution, you can increase it to 0.3. If the algorithm ends up discarding too many molecules, you can gradually raise this threshold.\n",
