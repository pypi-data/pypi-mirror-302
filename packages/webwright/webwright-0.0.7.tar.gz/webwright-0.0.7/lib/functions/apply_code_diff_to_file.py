    Applies a code pseudo diff to a file using Gemini AI for analysis and suggestion.

    :param diff: The code pseudo diff to be applied, with + or - on front of lines changes. 
                 This should be a string representation of the changes, typically in a format similar to the output of 'git diff'. This strictly does not need to be perfect but should include all changes required. The calling LLM should always use + for new lines and - for line deletions.
