This project is for you if you're looking to use Python to

* Deploy smart contracts
* Transfer NEP-11 and NEP-17 tokens
* Vote for your favourite consensus node
* Interact with on-chain smart contracts
* Manage wallets
* Build and sign specialized transactions
* and more..

This SDK provides building blocks for Python developers to interact with the NEO blockchain without requiring to run a full node.
In order to interact with the chain and obtain information it relies heavily on RPC nodes. You can find a list of public RPC nodes `here <https://dora.coz.io/monitor>`_.

Please report any issues on `Github <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-mamba/issues>`_ or submit ideas how to improve the SDK.

Also check out our Python smart contract compiler `Boa <https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo3-boa>`_ !

Installation and usage
----------------------
Installation instructions, how to interact with smart contracts as well as API reference documentation can be found at
https://mamba.coz.io/

Developing or contributing
--------------------------
Install the requirements, modify the code and PR :-)
::

   pip install -e .[dev]

For larger changes consider opening an issue first to discuss the change. Below are a few guidelines for contributing

* The project uses `Black <https://github.com/psf/black>`_ for code formatting. PRs will fail if formatted incorrectly.
  You might want to `integrate <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html>`_ ``black`` into your
  editor or run it manually with ``make black``.
* All public functions/classes must have docstrings.
* All your code must be typed. Test your typing with ``make type``. In rare cases it might be hard/impractical to add typing.
  Point it out if that is the case and add a short description why we could do without.
* Add tests that cover the newly added (or changed if applicable) code. Use ``make test`` and ``make coverage``.
