# OwlApp

Web based SQL query editor for your files, databases and cloud storage data.

Currently you can use it to query:
- Local files
- Cloud Storage Files (gcs, s3)
- Postgresql Database
- Duckdb Database

- You can create multiple users and each user can manage their user space (databases, connections, etc..)
- Has builtin user authentication and google oauth support.

- You can also upload files and query them.

## Installation

```sh
# Make sure you have python version 3.12
# probably works with >=3.10, <=3.12 but didn't check all in between

# create a directory in your favorite place like ~/projects/owlapp
mkdir ~/projects/owlapp && cd ~/projects/owlapp

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install owlapp
pip install owlapp
```

## Quick Start

Start with basic options.

```sh
# Initialize it with basic settings
owl init all

# Run it
owl run

# Now open your browser and see the examples.

# `init all` command generates a few example files and database.
# (use GENERATE_EXAMPLES=false to disable)
# check out the examples once you login.
```

- Run the following command see command line usage.

```sh
owl --help
```

See `.env` file for configuration options.

## Usage

### Databases

You can create as many databases as you want. If you didn't create any database then
an `in memory database` will be used for your queries. In memory database will only execute
`SELECT` queries. Other statement types are not supported.

### Querying uploaded files

You can query the files using the following pattern:
```sql
-- example
-- if you have uploaded a file named `addresses.csv`
-- you can query it using the following query;
select * from '{{files}}/addresses.csv'
```
`{{files}}` are the base path of the uploaded files.


### Downloading result-set
- You can use the `download` icon on the `Script Toolbar` to download last executed query result.


### Macros

You can create macros and use default macros on the sql scripts. Example to default macros are;

- `{{files}}` which resolves to data files base path
- `{{ref('script_name_without_extension')}}` which resolves to a sub-query that is the content of the script.

```sql

-- Example to {{files}}
select * from '{{files}}/addresses.csv'
-- Assuming you have a uploaded a data file named `addresses.csv`
-- Above script will resolve to the path of that file and will be something like;
-- select * from 'path/to/data-files/addresses.csv''

-- Example to {{ref}}
-- * Given that you have defined a macro like this in the `Macros` section in any file.:
{% macro greet(name) %}
  'Hello, {{ name }}!'
{% endmacro %}
-- * Given you have script file named 'demo.sql' which contains the following.
select {{ greet('Alice')}} as Greet, t.* from '{{files}}/addresses.csv' as t

-- * Given you have another script which contains the following SQL expression.
select * from {{ref('demo')}}

-- * This will resolve to
select * from
    (select
  'Hello, Alice!'
 as Greet, t.* from 'path/to/data-files/addresses.csv' as t)
```

### User Management

Currently you can only manage users using cli. Use the following command to see available options.
```sh
❯ owl users --help
Usage: owl users [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  User management commands

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create           Create a new user
  delete           Delete a user
  list             List all users
  update           Update a user
  update-password  Update the password of a user
```

## UI Shortcut Keys

- `Command-\`, `CTRL-\`: Render resolved selected statement or entire script if no selection.
- `Command-Enter`, `CTRL-Enter` : Execute selected statement or entire script if no selection.
- `Command-S`, `CTRL-S` : Save content


## Query Engine

- First [macro](#macros) resolution is done on the given statement.
- After [macros](#macros) are resolved, Everything is executed by [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/)


## Development

We have [backend](./owl/server/) and [frontend](./owl/webapp/) separated in respective directories.

#### Backend

- It's a classic flask application and we use [apiflask](https://apiflask.com/)
- We use:
  - Alembic for migrations
  - Currently supports sqlite and postgres for repository.
  - Click for the `cli`
  - `pytest` for testing
- If you are familiar with above it's super easy to get started.
- Check the [Makefile](./Makefile) for the available targets.


#### Frontend

- We use react, it's my first time using react so probably there are tons of possible improvement points.
- Initialized a testing setup but didn't cover much.


### TODO

- [ ] Complete security and isolation of user data.
- [ ] Add CI support
- [ ] Robust tests on the frontend side
- [ ] More automation on `develop > build > publish` path.
- [ ] Better error messages
- [ ] Move those `todos` to GH Issues.
