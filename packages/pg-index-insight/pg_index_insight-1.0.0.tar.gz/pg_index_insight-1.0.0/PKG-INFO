# pgindexinsight
pgindexinsight is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help PostgreSQL users analyze and optimize the efficiency of their database indexes. The tool highlights inefficient indexes, offering insights to improve space utilization, vacuum operations, and overall database performance without the need for external extensions or packages.

# Why Choose pgindexinsight?
pgindexinsight offers a simple yet powerful way to ensure that your PostgreSQL indexes are running efficiently. Here are key reasons to choose this tool:

- No Extensions or Packages Required: Unlike other PostgreSQL performance tools, pgindexinsight doesn’t require the installation of any database extensions or other packages. It keeps your database setup clean and reduces complexity.
- No Need to Memorize Index Queries: The tool uses pre-defined queries to analyze your indexes, so you don’t have to recall or memorize the correct index analysis queries every time. This provides a hassle-free experience for database inspection.
- Minimal Setup: The tool is easy to install and use. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned database administrator, pgindexinsight is designed to make index management intuitive and straightforward.
- Portable & Lightweight: As a standalone CLI tool, pgindexinsight can be run in any environment with PostgreSQL access. There’s no dependency on external software, so you can freely install or remove it whenever needed.

## Key Features
1. Index Usage Analysis: Detect redundant, unused, or bloated indexes and ensure your database operates efficiently.
2. Comprehensive Reporting: Generate detailed reports on index health, usage, and redundancy.
3. JSON Export Support: Easily export the results of your analyses in JSON format for further processing or integration with other systems.
4. User-Friendly CLI: The tool is designed with ease of use in mind, allowing database administrators and developers to get started with minimal effort.

## Benefits

- Keep your PostgreSQL database clean: No need to install or manage third-party database extensions.
- Flexible: Run the tool only when needed, and easily remove it afterward if no longer required.
- Empowers Database Administrators: Get valuable insights into your index usage to optimize performance and space, without any extra overhead.
