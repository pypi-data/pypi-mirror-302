def update_metadata_from_dict(metadata_dict, new_filename, destination_dir):
    """
    Creates a metadata file based on the provided dictionary of metadata values and saves it
    to the specified destination directory. Additionally, a subdirectory with the same name
    as the metadata file (excluding the file extension) is created in the destination directory.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    metadata_dict : dict
        A dictionary containing the metadata key-value pairs. The keys should match the metadata
        field names (e.g., 'TITLE', 'TIME PERIOD', 'DESCRIPTION', etc.). If a key is missing,
        the function will use a default value based on a predefined template.

    new_filename : str
        The name of the new metadata file to be created, including the file extension (e.g., 'metadata.txt').

    destination_dir : str
        The path to the directory where the new metadata file and subdirectory should be saved.
        If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

    Returns:
    -------
    str or None
        The full path to the newly created metadata file if the operation is successful.
        If an error occurs during the process, the function returns None.

    Example:
    -------
    metadata_dict = {
        'TITLE': 'Updated Phenocamera RGB image collection from Abisko Observatory',
        'TIME PERIOD': '2022-05-01 08:00:00 - 2022-12-31 18:00:00',
        'TIME RESOLUTION': 'HOURLY',
        'PROCESSING METHODS': 'Basic color correction applied',
        'DESCRIPTION': 'Updated collection of images with enhanced processing.',
    }

    new_filename = 'updated_metadata.txt'
    destination_dir = 'path_to_destination_directory'

    new_file_path = update_metadata_from_dict(metadata_dict, new_filename, destination_dir)
