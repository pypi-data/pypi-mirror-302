## Installation & Setup

For the best experience, use the Environment Manager on [lab.qbraid.com](https://lab.qbraid.com).
Login (or [create an account](https://account.qbraid.com)) and follow instructions in [user guide](https://docs.qbraid.com/lab/user-guide/environments) to get started.

The Environment manager requires **Python 3.9 or greater**, and is compatible with **JupyterLab 4.x**.

### Local Install

The Environment Manager can be installed using pip:

```shell
pip install jupyter-environment-manager
```

### Local Setup

To use the Environment Manager locally, you must configure your qBraid account credentials:

1. Create a qBraid account or log in to your existing account by visiting [account.qbraid.com](https://account.qbraid.com/)
2. Copy your API Key token from the left side of your account page (see [docs](https://docs.qbraid.com/home/account)).
3. Save your API key using the [qbraid-cli](https://docs.qbraid.com/cli/api-reference/qbraid_configure):

```bash
pip install qbraid-cli
qbraid configure
```

The command above stores your credentials locally in a configuration file `~/.qbraid/qbraidrc`,
where `~` corresponds to your home (`$HOME`) directory.

Alternatively, the Environment Manager can discover credentials from environment variables:

```bash
export QBRAID_API_KEY='QBRAID_API_KEY'
```
