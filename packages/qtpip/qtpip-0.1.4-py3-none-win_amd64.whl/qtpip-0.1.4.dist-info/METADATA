# Qt pip

This project aims to provide a wrapper around `pip`, but handling the Qt
account authentication for installing commercial wheels.

The expected behavior is to detect the `pip` command from a /hopefully/
activated virtual environment, falling back to all the commands, but not for
the install.

## Install

```
pip install qtpip
```

## Usage

```
qtpip install pyside6
```

## Issues

Major tasks and discovered use-cases that need to be implemented need to have
a JIRA entry, using the `Qt pip` component.
