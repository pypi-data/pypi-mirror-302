# Tokenize2

Tokenize2 is an improved byte-level BPE tokenizer, inspired by models like GPT-3, designed for efficient tokenization of text into subword units. It supports special tokens and byte-level text handling for robust tokenization, including for non-ASCII characters.

## Features

- Byte-level tokenization for handling a wide range of characters
- Special tokens (like `<PAD>`, `<UNK>`) for flexible token management
- Supports efficient BPE merges for subword tokenization
- Suitable for natural language processing and text generation tasks
