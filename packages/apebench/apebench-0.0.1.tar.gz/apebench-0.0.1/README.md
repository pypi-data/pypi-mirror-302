## Background

Autoregressive neural emulators can be used to efficiently forecast transient
phenomena, often associated with differential equations. Denote by
$\mathcal{P}_h$ a reference numerical simulator (e.g., the [FTCS
scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTCS_scheme) for the heat equation). It
advances a state $u_h$ by

$$
u_h^{[t+1]} = \mathcal{P}_h(u_h^{[t]}).
$$

An autoregressive neural emulator $f_\theta$ is trained to mimic $\mathcal{P}_h$, i.e., $f_\theta \approx \mathcal{P}_h$. Doing so requires the following choices:

1. What is the reference simulator $\mathcal{P}_h$?
    1. What is its corresponding continuous transient partial differential
        equation? (advection, diffusion, Burgers, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky,
        Navier-Stokes, etc.)
    2. What consistent numerical scheme is used to discretize the continuous
        transient partial differential equation?
2. What is the architecture of the autoregressive neural emulator $f_\theta$?
3. How do $f_\theta$ and $\mathcal{P}_h$ interact during training (=optimization
    of $\theta$)?
    1. For how many steps are their predictions unrolled and compared?
    2. What is the time-level loss function?
    3. How large is the batch size?
    4. What is the opimizer and its learning rate scheduler?
    5. For how many steps is the training run?
4. Additional training and evaluation related choices:
    1. What is the initial condition distribution?
    2. How long is the time horizon seen during training?
    3. What is the evaluation metric? If it is related to an error rollout, for
        how many steps is the rollout?
    4. How many random seeds are used to draw conclusions?

APEBench is a framework to holistically assess all four ingredients. Component
(1), the discrete reference simulator $\mathcal{P}_h$, is provided by `Exponax`.
This is a suite of
[ETDRK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021999102969950)-based
methods for semi-linear partial differential equations on periodic domains. This
covers a wide range of dynamics. For the most common scenarios, a unique
interface using normalized (non-dimensionalized) coefficients or a
difficulty-based interface (as described in the APEBench paper) can be used. The
second (2) component is given by `PDEquinox`. This library uses `Equinox`, a
JAX-based deep-learning framework, to implement many commonly found
architectures like convolutional ResNets, U-Nets, and FNOs. The third (3)
component is `Trainax`, an abstract implementation of "trainers" that provide
supervised rollout training and many other features. The fourth (4) component is
to wrap up the former three and is given by this repository.

### About APEBench

APEBench encapsulates the entire pipeline of training and evaluating an
autoregressive neural emulator in a scenario. A scenario is a callable
dataclass.


## Typical Workflow

### Workflow for a single training run

A `BaseScenario` consists of all the workflow needed to train autoregressive
neural emulatoAs. To access a pre-built scenario use either the
`apebench.normalized.XX` for normalized (=dimensionless) scenarios or
`apebench.physical.XX` for non-normalized scenarios. Also consider using the
difficulty based interface via `apebench.difficulty.XX`. As an example consider
the scenario with the 1d advection equation.

```python
import apebench

adv_scene = apebench.scenarios.difficulty.Advection()

print(adv_scene)

# Output:
Advection(
  num_spatial_dims=1,
  num_points=160,
  num_channels=1,
  ic_config='fourier;5;true;true',
  num_warmup_steps=0,
  num_train_samples=50,
  train_temporal_horizon=50,
  train_seed=0,
  num_test_samples=30,
  test_temporal_horizon=200,
  test_seed=773,
  optim_config='adam;10_000;warmup_cosine;0.0;1e-3;2_000',
  batch_size=20,
  num_trjs_returned=1,
  record_loss_every=100,
  vlim=(-1.0, 1.0),
  report_metrics='mean_nRMSE',
  callbacks='',
  gammas=(0.0, -4.0),
  coarse_proportion=0.5,
  adv_difficulty=4.0
)
```

We will discuss all the components later, for now it is just relevant to note that `num_spatial_dims=1`, telling us that we are in 1d.

A scenario is a collection of recipes that performs the following things for you:
1. Creation of sample trajectories, e.g., for training and validation. Use the
    methods `get_train_data()` and `get_test_data()` to access them. Or use the
    method `get_ref_sample_data()`  to get as many trajectories from the
    **test** dataset as described by the `num_trjs_returned` attribute.
2. Creation of the autoregressive neural stepper. This comes in two flavors,
    `get_network(...)` produces the `Equinox` architecture based on a
    configuraton string and a JAX random key. The method
    `get_neural_stepper(...)` also needs a task configuration key to embed the
    network with a coarse stepper if a correction scenario is requested.
3. Creation of the trainer. A trainer combines a learning methodology
    (supervised rollout training etc.) with stochastic minibatching. Use the
    method `get_trainer(...)` together with a train configuration string.
4. All in run of the scenario. This will instantiate a neural stepper, produce a
    train dataset, and train the neural stepper for `num_training_steps` steps.
    Afterwards, it performs a model evaluation and returns comprehensive data in
    form of a Pandas DataFrame and the trained neural stepper. It also allows to
    batch-parallel train multiple seeds at a time. Then, each row in the Pandas
    DataFrame corresponds to a single training run.

As an example, let's train a simple feedforward conv-net with 26 hidden
channels, 8 hidden layers and the relu activation function. We use a prediction
task (so the network shall fully replace the numerical solver) and train with
one step supervised deep learning. Let's also use 10 different random seeds.
Each seed affects the initialization of the network and the random sampling of
minibatches, but does **not** alter training or test data.

```python
data, trained_nets = adv_scene(
    task_config="predict",
    network_config="Conv;26;10;relu",
    train_config="one",
    num_seeds=10,
)
```

A progress bar will appear. On a modern GPU training should be ~2 min.

The data is still in a raw format which means that each training loss recorded
and each metric rollout step recorded have their own column. In the terminology
of Pandas this is called a
[wide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/reshaping.html#melt-and-wide-to-long)
format. Precisely, you will find the following columns in the DataFrame:

1. `"scenario"`: a unique identifier string for the scenario. In our case, we
    will see `"1d_norm_linear_1"` telling us we are in 1d, we used a normalized
    scenario, and the larger category is "linear" (advection is a linear
    equation with a first order spatial derivative which is indicated by the
    number 1).
2. `"task"`: Same as we used in calling the scenario.
3. `"train"`: Same as we used in calling the scenario.
4. `"net"`: Same as we used in calling the scenario.
5. `"seed"`: The random seed used for this training run. (This is the one
    configuration column that actually varies between the rows)
6. `"scenario_kwargs"`: A string containing an empty dictionary, will become
    relevant later.
7. `"mean_nRMSE_XXXX"`: This is a rollout metric recorded after training.
8. `"train_loss_XXXXXX"`: Denoting the training loss (associated with the "one"
    configuation) at update step `XXXXXX`. You will see that the XXXXXX are
    spaced by 100 which is the default logging frequency.
9. `"aux_XXXXXX"`: This represents auxiliary data produced by potential
    callbacks; not relevant for now.
9. `"sample_rollout_000"`: A representation of the trajectory with the trained
    network.

apebench provides utilities to convert this into a long format that is better
suited for postprocessing like visualization with seaborn. This requires exactly
knowing the name of the columns. Since apebench agrees to a fixed naming
convention, we can use one of its wrapped routines.

Let us start by investigating the training loss. For this, we will use the
utility `apebench.melt_loss`.

```python
data_loss = apebench.melt_loss(data)
```

This long DataFrame has the same first six configuration columns (`"scenario"`,
`"task"`, `"train"`, `"net"`, `"seed"`, `"scenario_kwargs"`) and two new columns
`"update_steps"` and `"train_loss"`.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.lineplot(data_loss, x="update_step", y="train_loss")
plt.yscale("log"); plt.show()
```

![](img/adv_training.png)

The training decreased the loss by five orders of magnitude.

Let's investigate the metric rollout

```python
data_metrics = apebench.melt_metrics(data)

sns.lineplot(data_metrics, x="time_step", y="mean_nRMSE")
plt.ylim(-0.05, 1.05); plt.grid(); plt.show()
```

![](img/adv_metric_rollout.png)

And we can also plot a sample rollout

```python
import numpy as np

data_sample_rollout = apebench.melt_sample_rollouts(data)

plt.imshow(np.array(data_sample_rollout["sample_rollout"][0])[:, 0, :].T, origin="lower", aspect="auto", vmin=-1, vmax=1, cmap="RdBu_r")
plt.xlabel("time"); plt.ylabel("space"); plt.show()
```

![](img/adv_sample_rollout.png)

### Running interface

Instead of instantiating a scenario and calling it, we can also index it from
the `apebench.scenarios.scenario_dict`. Most conveniently, this can be done with
the `apebench.run_experiment`. We can achieve the same result as above by

```python
import apebench

apebench.run_experiment(
    scenario="diff_adv",
    task="predict",
    net="Conv;26;10;relu",
    train="one",
    start_seed=0,
    num_seeds=10,
)
```

(Smaller variations due to non-determinism of some operations on the GPU can
occur.)

### Workflow for a study of multiple experiments

The above workflow is for a single training run. For apebench, we are interested
in comparing multiple architectures, training methodologies, and scenarios. So,
we will set up a list of dictionaries describing the configurations. Let's say
we wanted to compare the conv net with an FNO. We will configure the Fourier
Neural Operator with 12 active modes, 8 hidden channels, and 4 blocks. Then we
would write

```python
CONFIGS = [
    {
        "scenario": "diff_adv",
        "task": "predict",
        "net": "Conv;26;10;relu",
        "train": "one",
        "start_seed": 0,
        "num_seeds": 10,
    },
    {
        "scenario": "diff_adv",
        "task": "predict",
        "net": "FNO;12;8;4;gelu",
        "train": "one",
        "start_seed": 0,
        "num_seeds": 10,
    },
]
```

Notice, that only the `net` key has changed. So we can use a list comprehension
to create the `CONFIGS` list:

```python
CONFIGS = [
    {
        "scenario": "diff_adv",
        "task": "predict",
        "net": net,
        "train": "one",
        "start_seed": 0,
        "num_seeds": 10,
    }
    for net in ["Conv;26;10;relu", "FNO;12;8;4;gelu"]
]
```

We will use the `apebench.run_study_convenience` to run the entire study.
This function returns the the melted data for metrics, loss, and sample rollouts
(in this order) and a list of paths where the network weights are stored.

```python
(
    metric_df,
    loss_df,
    sample_rollout_df,
    network_weights_list,
) = apebench.run_study_convenience(
    CONFIGS, do_loss=True, do_metrics=True, do_sample_rollouts=True
)
```

Runtime for this study should be around 4 minutes on a modern GPU. (If you
ran the study a second time, it will load the results from disk.)

Let's produce plots. First for the loss history

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.lineplot(loss_df, x="update_step", y="train_loss", hue="net")
plt.yscale("log"); plt.show()
```

![](img/adv_experiment_training.png)

Then for the metric rollout

```python
sns.lineplot(metric_df, x="time_step", y="mean_nRMSE", hue="net")

plt.ylim(-0.05, 1.05); plt.grid(); plt.show()
```

![](img/adv_experiment_metric_rollout.png)

We can also make a tabular export (using the median over the 10 seeds)

```python
print(metric_df.groupby(
    ["net", "time_step"]
)[["mean_nRMSE"]].median().reset_index().pivot(
    index="time_step",
    columns="net"
).query(
    "time_step in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]"
).round(3).to_markdown())
```

## Extending APEBench

You can have experiments run with your architectures. For this, you have to
register them in the `apebench.arch_extensions` dictionary.

```python
import apebench

def conv_net_extension(
    config_str: str,
    num_spatial_dims: int,
    num_channels: int,
    *,
    key: PRNGKeyArray,
):
    config_args = config_str.split(";")

    depth = int(config_args[1])

    return pdeqx.arch.ConvNet(
        num_spatial_dims=num_spatial_dims,
        in_channels=num_channels,
        out_channels=num_channels,
        hidden_channels=42,
        depth=depth,
        activation=jax.nn.relu,
        key=key,
    )

apebench.arch_extensions.update(
    {"MyConvNet": conv_net_extension}
)
```

Then you can use the `Conv` architecture in the `net` configuration string.

```python
apebench.run_experiment(
    scenario="diff_adv",
    task="predict",
    net="MyConvNet;42",
    train="one",
    start_seed=0,
    num_seeds=10,
)
```


## Defining your own Scenario

### Modify an existing Scenario

When instantiating a scenario, use keyword based arguments to change some of the
attributes. For example, this uses less initial conditions for training the
standard advection scenario.

```python
import apebench

modified_adv_scene = apebench.scenarios.difficulty.Advection(
    num_train_samples=10,
)
```

Or if you use the string based interface, you can add additional keyword arguments that match the attribute names of the scenario.

```python
import apebench

apebench.run_experiment(
    scenario="diff_adv",
    task="predict",
    net="Conv;26;10;relu",
    train="one",
    start_seed=0,
    num_seeds=10,
    # Below are the additional keyword arguments
    num_train_samples=10,
)
```

Or if you run entire study, you can also add additional keyword arguments that match the attribute names of the scenario.

```python
CONFIGS = [
    {
        "scenario": "diff_adv",
        "task": "predict",
        "net": net,
        "train": "one",
        "start_seed": 0,
        "num_seeds": 10,
        # Below are the additional keyword arguments
        "num_train_samples": 10,
    }
    for net in ["Conv;26;10;relu", "FNO;12;8;4;gelu"]
]
```

### Your truly own Scenario

If you decide to implement your own scenario, you have to subclass `BaseScenario` and implement the following methods:

1. `get_ref_stepper()`
2. `get_coarse_stepper()` (or implement a raise Notimplemented error if your
    scenario does not support a correction mode)
3. `get_scenario_name()`

Of course, feel free to overwrite some of the other methods if you are unhappy
witht the options, for example to support more network architectures or training
methodologies.

## Common Patterns in Apebench

* Configuration strings: many configurations (like network architecture, initial
  condition distribution, optimization config, learning methodology, etc.) are
  set up in terms of string which contains the configuration entries separated
  by a semi-colon ";".

## Gotchas

**Gotcha**: When subclassing from `BaseScenario` and overriding some of the
attributes those need to be typed similarly to the base class.


## Tips and Tricks

**Avoid excessive storage usage for experiments**:

* Reduce the number of exported trajectories. This is 1 by default, but in 2d
    this can cause excessive memory usage
* Reduce the logging frequency with `record_loss_every`.
