# NuminousAI

NuminousAI is a Python package designed to provide a comprehensive interface for interacting with various AI models and performing a range of functionalities such as URL interaction, system command execution, and more. This package is intended to serve as a robust tool for developers and researchers working with AI technologies.

# Features

### CerebrasAI Integration with NuminousAI

`CerebrasAI` is a Python class designed to interact with the Cerebras Cloud API, leveraging powerful models such as `llama3.1-8b` for text generation tasks. The class simplifies API key management, ensures seamless interaction with the Cerebras API, and offers a robust text generation interface.

This class is a part of the `NuminousAI` project and extends functionality from the `AIBase` class, which provides common utilities and paths for the project.

## Features

- **Model Support**: Supports Cerebras models such as `llama3.1-8b` and `llama3.1-70b`.
- **API Key Management**: Automatically fetches and manages Cerebras API keys using Selenium to handle authentication.
- **Chrome User Data Syncing**: Synchronizes Chrome user data to ensure cookies and session data are available for authentication.
- **Text Generation Interface**: Allows for sending questions or prompts to the Cerebras models with customizable parameters like temperature, max tokens, and system prompts.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for expired API keys, connection errors, and general exceptions.
- **Streaming Support**: Option to stream responses in real-time.

## Installation

You can install the package via `pip`:

```pip install NuminousAI```
# Requirements
- `Python 3.6+`: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
- `requests>=2.0.0`: For making HTTP requests to the Cerebras API.
- `click>=8.1.7`: For building command-line interfaces (CLI).
- `appdirs>=1.4.4`: For handling platform-specific directories (used to store config files).
- `tqdm>=4.66.4`: For showing progress bars in the console.
- `selenium>=4.20.0`: For automating Chrome browser tasks and fetching cookies.
- `cerebras_cloud_sdk>=1.5.0`: Official SDK for interacting with Cerebras models.

# Usage

```python
from NuminousAI.Provider.CerebrasAI import CerebrasAI

Cerebras = CerebrasAI()
if __name__ == "__main__":
    deepinfra_response = DeepInfra.generate("Hi")
    print(f'DeepInfraAI: {deepinfra_response}')
```
