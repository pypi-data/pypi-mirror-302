# 2024-07-15: Power and Prediction, ML, and Grid Dynamics

This note focuses on various areas of research and development, including machine learning (ML) for predictive maintenance, process modeling with BPMN/CMMN/DMN, and grid dynamics in system control. Key tasks include preparing KPI goals for August, reviewing epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks for project management, and collaborating with industry leaders. Additionally, thereâ€™s emphasis on going through old resources, reviewing manuals (e.g., Cray supercomputer), and enhancing the Enterprise Kaizen model.
