# EPL Remade
Every Python Library Remade, is a project that aims to improve on the base python modules and libraries. Although still under the works, you may expect bit releases of the libraries in the future. The libraries will be released in the form of a package, and will be available on PyPi, GitHub and other platforms.

## Libraries
- [ ] `complexnum` - This is completely custom library that can be used for algebraic operations on complex numbers involving variables
- [ ] `rmath` - This is a direct improvement on the base python `math` module, with added functions and improvements
- [ ] `matrixop` - This is a custom library that can be used for matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
- [ ] `rtype` - This is a custom library that can be used for type checking and type conversion, with added functions and improvements
- [ ] `rnetwork` - This is a custom library that can be used for network operations, including sending and receiving data, etc.
- [ ] `rfunctools` - This is a custom library that can be used for functional programming, with added functions and improvements
- [ ] `algorithms` - This is a custom library that can be used for algorithms, including sorting, searching, etc.
- [ ] `circuit` - This is a custom library that can be used for operations such as AND, OR, NOT, etc.
