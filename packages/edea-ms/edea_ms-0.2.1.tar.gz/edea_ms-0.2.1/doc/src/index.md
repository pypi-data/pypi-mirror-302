# Introduction

EDeA Measurement Server (edea-ms for short) is a measurement data sharing and collaboration platform for engineering teams.
It shares a lot of ideas with the Keysight TestOps Manifesto and is complemented by the Test and Measurement as Code library [edea-tmc](https://edea-dev.gitlab.io/edea-tmc/).

In short, it can manage projects and host the measurement results for different testruns so that they can be stored and analyzed.
