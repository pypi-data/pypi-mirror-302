DESCRIPTION = """
There are three methods of becoming a practitioner: being part of a family of practitioners, stumbling across knowledge belonging to Others by chance, and finally, making direct deals with Others in order to gain their knowledge. The third happens to be the oldest, and the road our protagonists end up going down. Three teenagers, Verona, Lucy, and Avery, are awakened as practitioners in order to solve a mystery in the town of Kennet, Ontario.
