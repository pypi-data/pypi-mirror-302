============
TAP-Producer
============

Producer for Test Anything Protocol output in Python.
Automatically counts test points at call time for TAP version 12, 13, and 14.
TAP version 12 supports plan, ok, not ok, diagnostic, and bail out functionality.
TAP version 13 supports the aforementioned as well as subtest context manager
and YAML diagnostic output.
TAP version 14 supports all prior version features but separates the API
for comments output from YAML diagnostics.

TAP-Producer also includes an end convenience method as well as two decorators.
A suppress context manager for suppressing diagnostic and bail out messages;
a strict context manager for raising not ok test cases to Python errors.
