### 3.1 SPARQL Query

To send a SPARQL query using OP Cellar, you need to import the `send_sparql_query` function from the `op_cellar.sparql` module. Here is an example:

```python
from op_cellar.sparql import send_sparql_query

sparql_results_table = send_sparql_query("path_to_sparql_file", "path_to_output_file")
```
Replace `"path_to_sparql_file"` with the actual path to your SPARQL query file and `"path_to_output_file"` with the desired output file path.
