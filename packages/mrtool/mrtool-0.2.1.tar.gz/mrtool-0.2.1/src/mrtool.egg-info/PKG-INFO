MRTool
======


**MRTool** (Meta-Regression Tool) package is designed to solve general meta-regression problem.
The most interesting features include,

* linear and log prediction function,
* spline extension for covariates,
* direct Gaussian, Uniform and Laplace prior on fixed and random effects,
* shape constraints (monotonicity and convexity) for spline.

Advanced features include,

* spline knots ensemble,
* automatic covariate selection.


Installation
------------

Use pip to install the package

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install mrtool
