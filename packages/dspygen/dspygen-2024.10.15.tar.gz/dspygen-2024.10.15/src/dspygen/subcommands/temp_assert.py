story = """Chaining language model (LM) calls as com- posable dspy_modules is fueling a new powerful way of programming. 
However, ensuring that LMs adhere to important constraints remains a key challenge, one often addressed with 
heuristic “prompt engineering”. We introduce LM Asser- tions, a new programming construct for express- ing 
computational constraints that LMs should satisfy. We integrate our constructs into the re- cent DSPy programming 
model for LMs, and present new strategies that allow DSPy to com- pile programs with arbitrary LM Assertions into 
systems that are more reliable and more accu- rate. In DSPy, LM Assertions can be integrated at compile time, 
via automatic prompt optimiza- tion, and/or at inference time, via automatic self- refinement and backtracking. We 
report on two early case studies for complex question answer- ing (QA), in which the LM program must iter- atively 
retrieve information in multiple hops and synthesize a long-form answer with citations. We find that LM Assertions 
improve not only compli- ance with imposed rules and guidelines but also enhance downstream task performance, 
deliver- ing intrinsic and extrinsic gains up to 35.7% and 13.3%, respectively. Our reference implementa- tion of LM 
Assertions is integrated into DSPy at dspy.ai."""
