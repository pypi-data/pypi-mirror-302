        Test that the send_email_async function successfully sends an email.

        This test verifies that when `send_email_async` is called with valid parameters:
        - The SMTP server is correctly initialized with the specified host and port.
        - The login method is called with the correct credentials.
        - The email is sent with the expected 'From', 'To', 'Subject', and 'Body' fields.
        - The SMTP connection is properly terminated with a call to `quit`.
        - The success log message is correctly written.

        Mocks:
        ------
        - `django_logging.utils.log_email_notifier.notifier.SMTP` to simulate SMTP interactions.
        - `django_logging.utils.log_email_notifier.notifier.settings` to provide mock email settings.
        - `django_logging.utils.log_email_notifier.notifier.logger.info` and `logger.warning` to test logging behavior.

        Asserts:
        -------
        - The `SMTP` object was called with the correct host and port.
        - The `login` method was called with the correct credentials.
        - The `sendmail` method was called with the correct email fields.
        - The `quit` method was called on the SMTP instance.
        - The success message was logged and no warning message was logged.
