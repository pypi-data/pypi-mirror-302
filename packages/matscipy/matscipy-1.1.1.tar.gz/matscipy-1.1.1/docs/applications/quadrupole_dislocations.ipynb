    "Dislocation Quadrupoles are structures designed with the goal of enabling the study of dislocation systems in periodic cells. In order for the system to be periodic, the cell must have a net Burgers vector of zero. To achieve this, we place two dislocations with Burgers vectors of equal magnitude and opposite sign (i.e. $+\\textbf{b}$ and $-\\textbf{b}$) in the structure.\n",

    "To build dislocation quadrupoles, we can use the `Quadrupole` class. The `__init__()` method of the class takes a dislocation class (e.g. `DiamondGlide90degreePartial`), followed by args and/or kwargs used to initialise that dislocation class (i.e, `C11`, `C12`, `C44`, and either `alat` or a bulk structure). From here, there are many class methods which generate different kinds of structures. Let's first look at the basic quadrupole structure, using `build_quadrupole`"
