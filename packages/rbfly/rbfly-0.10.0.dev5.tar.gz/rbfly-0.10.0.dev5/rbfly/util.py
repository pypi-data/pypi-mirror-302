    Optional type.

    This differes from `typing.Optional`

    - use `Option.empty` property to check if value is set
    - use `Option.value` to retrieve non-null value; if value is not set,
      then assertion error is raised

    Use of null values is not allowed.

    Supported::

    This is not expressed with type annotations below, unfortunately.
