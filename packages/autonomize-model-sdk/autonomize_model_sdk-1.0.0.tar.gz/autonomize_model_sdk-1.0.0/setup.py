# ModelHub SDK

The ModelHub SDK is a comprehensive toolkit designed to streamline the creation, management, and deployment of machine learning pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with ModelHub, a robust platform for developing and deploying machine learning models. This SDK provides an intuitive API for interacting with various ModelHub components, including MLflow for experiment tracking and pipeline orchestration.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into well-defined modules for core functionalities, client implementations, models, and utilities.
- **MLflow Integration**: Simplifies interaction with MLflow for tracking experiments, logging metrics, and managing model artifacts.
- **Pipeline Management**: Tools for creating, updating, and submitting machine learning pipelines efficiently.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes helper functions for common tasks such as logging setup and file encoding.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extendable for future enhancements and additional features.

## Installation

To install the ModelHub SDK, run:

pip install autonomize-model-sdk
