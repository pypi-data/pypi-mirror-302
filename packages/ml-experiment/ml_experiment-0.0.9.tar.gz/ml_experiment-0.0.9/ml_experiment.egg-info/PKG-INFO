## Introduction

This Python package facilitates the fast prototyping of
machine learning model with great scalability and flexibility.

Characteristics of this package:

* Flexibility of Feature Engineering: it is convenient to define a function to 
put to feature-processing pipeline;
* Flexibility of Models: there is no restriction about whether you have to use
scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch;
* Few Specifications on Models: user only need to worry about the `fit`
and `predict_proba`;
* Training Job Specifications: features, data locations, model specifications can
be specified in a Python dictionary or JSON, facilitating potential
MapReduce or parallelism;
* Scalability: data is stored temporarily in disks in batch
to save memory space;
* Statistics: statistical measures of the performance of the models and
their class labels are calculated;
* Cross Validation: cross validation option is available.
* Ready Adaptation to Production: data pipelines and algorithms can be adapted into
production codes with little changes.

There will be tutorials and documentations.
