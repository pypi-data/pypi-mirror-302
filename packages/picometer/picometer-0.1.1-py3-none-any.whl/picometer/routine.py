"""
Picometer routine file in a yaml file that contains a list of settings
and instructions to be sequentially executed by the parser.
In accordance with the yaml format, the file can comprise several
"yaml files" / "picometer routines" seperated by "\n---".
However, these "files"/"routines" are ultimately concatenated
and converted into a list of instructions.
