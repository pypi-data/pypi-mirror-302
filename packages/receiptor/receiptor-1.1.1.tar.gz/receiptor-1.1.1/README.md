# Receiptor Package

## Overview

Receiptor is a Python package designed to extract receipt, invoice, and order data from a user's Gmail account. It provides an easy-to-use interface for developers to fetch and structure email data, including attachments. The package also includes a feature that uses LLMs (Language Model Models) to structure the extracted data into JSON format.

structured_data = DocumentStructureExtractor.structure_document_data(
        raw_text=data.attachments[0].attachment_raw_text
        ,openai_api_key = "" , org_id = ""
    )

Note : org_id is optional , if you are using any organisation project then you may require this org_id ,
which can be obtained through open ai account dashboard.

```

### 5. Fetch and process receipt data

```python

for data in obj.fetch_receipt_data(access_token=access_token):
    print(data)
    if data.attachments:
        # Print the raw text of the first attachment
        print(data.attachments[0].attachment_raw_text)
        
        # Structure the attachment text using DocumentStructureExtractor
        structured_data = DocumentStructureExtractor.structure_document_data(
            raw_text=data.attachments[0].attachment_raw_text ,openai_api_key = "your api key" , org_id = "org id but this is optional"
        )
