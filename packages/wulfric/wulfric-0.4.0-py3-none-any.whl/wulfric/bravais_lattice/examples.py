    Return an example of the lattice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lattice_name : str, optional
        Name of the lattice to be returned.
        For available names see documentation of each Bravais lattice class.
        Lowercased before usage.
    convention : str, optional
        Name of the convention that is used for cell standardization.
        Supported conventions are:
        * "sc" - for Setyawan and Curtarolo standardization.

        By default the lattice is not standardized.

        .. versionadded:: 0.3.1

    Returns
    -------
    lattice : Lattice or list
        :py:class:`.Lattice` class is returned.
        If no math found a list with available examples is returned.
