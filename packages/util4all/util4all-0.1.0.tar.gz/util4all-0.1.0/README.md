# Utils for All 
***The main library of the enterprise*** 

### 1. **Install `venv` Module (if needed)**
The `venv` module is included in Python 3.3 and later, but make sure it's installed:

```bash
# On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you might need to install it explicitly:
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```

### 2. **Create a New Virtual Environment**
In your project folder, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv_name
```

- Replace `venv_name` with your desired name for the virtual environment (commonly just `venv`).
- This command creates a `venv_name/` directory with all the files
