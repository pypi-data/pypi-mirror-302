> [!NOTE]  
> The output file is a `SPDX-2.3` `SPDXRef-DOCUMENT` that merges all available `*.spdx.json` files from the manifest's installed packages.

> [!TIP]  
> The default `triplet` is `x64-windows` and is appended to the cmd line given path before searching for all installed packages.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The output files (`*.spdx.json`, and optionally, `*_license_info.json` and `*_EULA.txt`) are written to the current working directory from where the command was executed.

## Acknowledgements / Material

- vcpkg` spdx [info](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/reference/software-bill-of-materials) and [discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/discussions/40700) @ Microsoft docs
- The merging code was adapted from https://github.com/philips-software/SPDXMerge
- The `jq` script [here](https://edgebit.io/blog/merge-two-sboms/) is a nice alternative
- [licensecpp](https://github.com/cenit/licencpp/tree/master) is another approach starting from the `vcpkg` manifest.json file.

## Disclaimer / Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> As indicated at the `vcpkg` [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/reference/vcpkg-json#license):
> _The licensing information provided for each package in the vcpkg registry represents Microsoft's best understanding of the licensing requirements. However, this information may not be definitive. Users are advised to verify the exact licensing requirements for each package they intend to use, as it is ultimately their responsibility to ensure compliance with the applicable licenses._

While `vcpkg` offers a lot of information about licensing, this information should be scrutinized. Any tool that builds on top of this information provided by `vcpkg` is reliant on the legibility of the provided data, and should thus, be also scrutinized for correctness.
