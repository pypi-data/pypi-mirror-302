Spatial variations in the demodulation matrices are now fit on a per-IFU-group basis.
First, a demodulation matrix is fit for every illuminated spatial pixel and these results are fit as a function of spatial pixel within each IFU group.
These polynomial fits (order is a pipeline parameter) mitigate noise in the individual demodulation matrices.
We still average all wavelengths in each spatial pixel because the demodulation matrices have been shown to be constant with wavelength.
