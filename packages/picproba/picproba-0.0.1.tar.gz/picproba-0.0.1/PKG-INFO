Probability distributions management
This package provides classes for Probability distributions and parametric families of probability distributions, with a particular focus on log density and Kullback--Leibler divergence.
Probability distributions and family of probability distributions can be easily transformed.
NOTE: numba requirement is currently pinned to 0.58, as other versions have not yet been fully tested. This notably impacts the version of numpy (<2). This should be fixed in future versions.
