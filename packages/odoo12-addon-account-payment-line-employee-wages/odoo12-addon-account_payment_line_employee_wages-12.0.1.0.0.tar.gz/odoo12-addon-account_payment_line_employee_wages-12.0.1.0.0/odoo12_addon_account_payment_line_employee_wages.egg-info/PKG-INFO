        When creating an account_payment_line, chose by default an employee's
        bank account if two conditions are met:
        
        -  The selected partner is also an employee
        -  The payment is part of a wage retribution.
        
        Otherwise, keep the first partner's active bank account (as default).
        
        This us usefull when an employee has a different bank account for wage
        payments.

         Configuration
        ***************
        
        We use the `l10n_es` module for their `account_group_46` account payment
        group which is used for wage payments.
        
        To use this module we also need employees related to partners by their
        `address_home_id` field.
        
        *******
         Usage
        *******
        
        -  Prepare a partner with an employee associated (from now on "partner
           employee") with a bank accounts that it is not the first active one
           from its related partner.
        
        -  For a partner employee, generate one ore more `account_move` with the
           account of its journal items belonging to the
           `l10n_es.account_group_46` group.
        
           [`Invoicing > Accounting > Accounting Entries > Journal Entries`]
        
        -  Create a payment order from the generated journal items
        
           [`Invoicing > Payments > Payment Orders > Create > Create Payment
           Lines from Journal Items`]
        
        -  Select the partner employee as the partner for the payment order and
           add the move lines.
        
        -  Check that the employee bank account is selected by default in the
           payment line form
