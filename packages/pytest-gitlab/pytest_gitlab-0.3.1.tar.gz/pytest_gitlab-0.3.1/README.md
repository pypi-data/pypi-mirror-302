# pytest-gitlab

This is a pytest plugin that provides fixtures for interacting with a dockerized GitLab instance.

The code was factored out from [python-gitlab](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab) so all props and credits
go to them!

This package has some additional features that make it a bit more convenient to use.
