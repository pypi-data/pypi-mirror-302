    way of programming. However, ensuring that LMs adhere to important constraints remains a key
    challenge, one often addressed with heuristic “prompt engineering”. We introduce LM Assertions,
     a new programming construct for expressing computational constraints that LMs should satisfy.
     We integrate our constructs into the recent DSPy programming model for LMs, and present new
     strategies that allow DSPy to compile programs with arbitrary LM Assertions into systems
     that are more reliable and more accurate. In DSPy, LM Assertions can be integrated at compile
     time, via automatic prompt optimization, and/or at inference time, via automatic self- refinement
     and backtracking. We report on two early case studies for complex question answer- ing (QA),
     in which the LM program must iteratively retrieve information in multiple hops and synthesize a
     long-form answer with citations. We find that LM Assertions improve not only compliance with
     imposed rules and guidelines but also enhance downstream task performance, delivering intrinsic
     and extrinsic gains up to 35.7% and 13.3%, respectively. Our reference implementation of LM Assertions
     is integrated into DSPy at dspy.ai."""
