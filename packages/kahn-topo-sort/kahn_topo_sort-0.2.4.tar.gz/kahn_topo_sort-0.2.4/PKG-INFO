# Topological Sort Python Package

## Overview

This package helps with sorting arrays based on the info a 2d-array provides. It uses topological sorting and Kahn's algorithm to sort the given Array by which Item comes after which other Item, given by the 2d-array. The package also includes cycle detection, and an optional filtering function to display only the required elements. The output is color-coded for clarity, with red for cycle detection errors and green for valid filtered outputs.

## Features

- **Graph Creation**: Converts input data into a directed graph and an in-degree dictionary.
- **Topological Sorting**: Implements Kahn's algorithm to perform topological sorting.
- **Cycle Detection**: Detects and flags cyclic dependencies in the graph.
- **Result Filtering**: Filters the sorted result based on a user-provided list.
- **Color-Coded Output**: 
  - **Red** for cycle errors.
  - **Green** for valid filtered lists.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kahn-topo-sort
```

## Example

```python
from kahn-topo-sort import Topo_Sort as ToSo

# The dependecies are provided in this 2D Array
twoD_Array = [
    ['B', 'A', 'D', 'F'],
    ['D', 'F'],
    ['A', 'E', 'D', 'C'],
    ['F', 'C'],
]

# The items that need to be sorted are listed in this Array
Array = [
    'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'
]

# A graph and in_degree dictionary are created. Those are used to sort the 2D Array. Then the all the items that are not in the Array are removed from the sorted List.
graph, in_degree = ToSo.createGraph(twoD_Array)
sorted_list = ToSo.sort(graph=graph, in_degree=in_degree)
result = ToSo.filterList(sorted_list, Array)

print(result)

result = [
    'B', 'D', 'F', 'C'
]
```

## Methods

### `createGraph(data)`

- **Input**: A list of lists representing dependencies, e.g., `[['A', 'B'], ['B', 'C']]`.
- **Output**:
  - `graph`: A dictionary representing the directed graph.
  - `in_degree`: A dictionary mapping each node to its in-degree.

### `sort(graph, in_degree)`

- **Input**:
  - `graph`: The directed graph.
  - `in_degree`: The in-degree dictionary.
- **Output**: 
  - A list of nodes in topological order or `'CYCLE IN DATA'` if a cycle is detected.

### `filterList(ls, use)`

- **Input**:
  - `ls`: The list to be filtered (either a sorted list or `'CYCLE IN DATA'`).
  - `use`: A list of nodes to filter the result by.
- **Output**: 
  - A filtered, color-coded list.

## Error Handling

- **Cycle Detection**: The `sort` method returns `'CYCLE IN DATA'` if the graph contains cycles. This is displayed in red to alert the user of cyclic dependencies.
