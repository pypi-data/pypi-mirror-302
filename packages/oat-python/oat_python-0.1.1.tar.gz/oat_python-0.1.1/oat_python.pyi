        Optimize a cycle representative

        Specifically, we employ the "edge loss" method to find a solution `x'` to the problem 

        `minimize Cost(Ax + z)`

        where 
            - `x` is unconstrained
        - `z` is a cycle representative for a (persistent) homology class associated to `birth_simplex`
        - `A` is a matrix composed of a subset of columns of the Jordna basis
        - `Cost(z)` is the sum of the absolute values of the products `z_s * diameter(s)`.

        # Arguments

        - The `birth_simplex` of a cycle represenative `z` for a bar `b` in persistent homology.
        - The `constraint` type for the problem. The optimization procedure works by adding linear
        combinations of column vectors from the Jordan basis matrix computed in the factorization.
        This argument controls which columns are available for the combination.
          - (default) **"preserve PH basis"** adds cycles which appear strictly before `birth_simplex`
            in the lexicographic ordering on filtered simplex (by filtration, then breaking ties by
            lexicographic order on simplices) and die no later than `birth_simplex`.  **Note** this is
            almost the same as the problem described in [Escolar and Hiraoka, Optimal Cycles for Persistent Homology Via Linear Programming](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-4-431-55420-2_5)
            except that we can include essential cycles, if `birth_simplex` represents an essential class. 
          - **"preserve PH basis (once)"** adds cycles which (i) are distince from the one we want to optimize, and
            (ii) appear (respectively, disappear) no later than the cycle of `birth_simplex`.  This is a looser
            requirement than "preserve PH basis", and may therefore produce a tighter cycle.  Note,
            however, that if we perform this optimization on two or more persistent homology classes in a
            basis of cycle representatives for persistent homology, then the result may not be a
            persistent homology basis.
          - **"preserve homology class"** adds every boundary vector
          - "preserve homology calss (once)" adds every cycle except the one represented by `birth_simplex`



        # Returns

        - The vectors `b`, `x`, and `y`
          - We separate `x` into two components: one made up of codimension-1 simplices (labeled "difference in bounding chains"), and one made up of codimension-0 simplices (labeled "difference in essential cycles")
        - The objective values of the initial and optimized cycles
        - The number of nonzero entries in the initial and optimized cycles
