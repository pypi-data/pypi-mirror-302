### Untyped Modules - OBSOLETED!

**WARNING:** This project has been incorporated into grscheller.experimental

PyPI grscheller namespace modules originally intended for use with less strictly
typed code. Decided to use with strict typing, hence name change was needed.

* module `grscheller.untyped.nada`

#### Version correspondence

Except for import statements, the following two module releases are identical:

* grscheller.untyped.nada - v0.4.1         (no longer maintained)
* grscheller.experimental.nada - v0.1.0
