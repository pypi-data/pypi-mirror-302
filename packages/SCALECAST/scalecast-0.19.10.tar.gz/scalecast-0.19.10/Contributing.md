# Contributing

Want to contribute? Email mikekeith52@gmail.com with your ideas or open an [issue/feature request](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast/issues/new). The following is needed:  
- More models added to the library, such as a genetic algorithm and the n-beats model
- More example notebooks displayed on the [examples](https://scalecast-examples.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) webpage. If you fork the [scalecast-examples](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast-examples) repository and submit a merge request with a good notebook that showcases scalecast, we will host it and give you credit.    
- More [grids](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast/tree/main/src/scalecast/grids).  
- Fixing documentation typos and rewording for clarity.  

If you want to open a pull request, be sure to [test](https://github.com/mikekeith52/scalecast/tree/main/test) all changes first.
