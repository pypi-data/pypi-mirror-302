# LACSS

```sh
   pip install lacss
```
LACSS is a deep-learning model for single-cell segmentation from microscopy images. See references below:

## What's new (0.11)

You can now deploy the LACSS predictor as an GRPC server:

```sh
   python -m lacss.deploy.remote_server --modelpath=<model_file_path>
```

For a GUI client see the [Trackmate-Lacss](https://github.com/jiyuuchc/TrackMate-Lacss) project, which provides a FIJI/ImageJ plugin to perform cell segmentation/tracking in an interactive manner.


## Why LACSS?
> LACSS is designed to utilize **point labels** for model training. You have three options: (1) Label each cell with a single point, (2) label each cell with a single point and then label each image with a binary mask that covers all cells, or (3) Label each cell with a separate segmentation mask (as in standard supervised training). You can of course also combined these labels in any way you want.

### How to generate point label?

> If your data include nuclei counter-stain, the easist way to generate point label for your image is to use a [blob detection](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html) algorithm on the nuclei images:
