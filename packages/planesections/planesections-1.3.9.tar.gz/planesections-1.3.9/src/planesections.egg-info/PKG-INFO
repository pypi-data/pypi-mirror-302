           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# PlaneSections
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/cslotboom/planesections/raw/main/doc/img/Beam Image.png" width="500">
</p>

A lightweight finite element beam bending library built on libraries like [PyNite](https://github.com/JWock82/PyNite) and [OpenSeesPy](https://github.com/zhuminjie/OpenSeesPy).
The goal of PlaneSections is to make easy-to-use beam anayses, which can be used to quickly document structural calculations.


**NOTE:**
Units for force and length must be applied to the beam in a [consistent unit base for FEM](https://femci.gsfc.nasa.gov/units/index.html).
PlaneSections has been design with Metric units in mind in terms of scaling diagrams. For those using imperial units, results will work with a consitent unit basis, but the scale of the digrams may be off.

PlaneSections is a FEM solver! Results are only stored at nodes specified by the user - all intermediate values in plots are linearly interpolated.

## Installation
The default package is installable through pip.
```
pip -m install planesections

```
The package with the optional OpenSeesPy dependancy is installable with 
```
pip -m install planesections[opensees]

```

## Features:
2D and 3D beams can be anayzed under the following force types:
- Point loads
- Point Moments
- Line Element loads
- Linearly varying element loads (2D only).

Diagrams can also be made of 2D beams, but the support types that can be plotted are limited.

## Documentation
All major functions and classes are documented on read-the-docs: https://planesections.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Demo
The PlaneSections can analyze and document beam plots for calcualtions. Below we make a beam, create a diagram of it, then get the output bending moment and shear force diagrams. It's also possible to get rotation, and deflection diagrams but these are not shown here.

``` Python

import planesections as ps

# Define node locations, and support conditions
L = 5
beam = ps.newEulerBeam(L)

# Define beam and fixities
pinned = [1,1,0]
beam.setFixity(L*0.1, pinned, label = '1')
beam.setFixity(L*0.9, pinned)

# Define loads
Pz = -1
beam.addVerticalLoad(0, Pz, label = 'A')
beam.addVerticalLoad(L*0.5, 2*Pz, label = 'B')
beam.addVerticalLoad(L, Pz, label = 'C')
beam.addDistLoadVertical(0, L, Pz)
beam.addDistLoadVertical(1, L*0.3, 5*Pz)

# Plot the beam diagram
ps.plotBeamDiagram(beam)

# Run the analysis
analysis = ps.PyNiteAnalyzer2D(beam)
analysis.runAnalysis()

# Plot the SFD and BMD
ps.plotShear(beam)
ps.plotMoment(beam)
```

</p>


## Further Examples
See the examples folder for more examples!

## Solvers
The opensees solver is included as an optional dependancy. It is significantly faster than the PyNite solver (~100x), but the license is more limited in use. OpenSees allows commercial use of the package, but does not allow resale without permission, so use at your own risk! [OpenSees License.](https://opensees.github.io/OpenSeesDocumentation/developer/license.html)

Some restrictions exist for OpenSees license, so this library has been added as an optional dependancy


## Status
PlaneSections is almost "feature complete" in terms of it's analysis functionality. The only additional analysis features I might include are:
- Spring supports
- Internal hinges
- Better cross section support
These are not slated to be in the next release.
