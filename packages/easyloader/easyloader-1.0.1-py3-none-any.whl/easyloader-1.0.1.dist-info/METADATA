## The basics

**EasyLoader** provides a set of ready-to-use PyTorch DataSet and DataLoader classes that efficiently load data from a variety of sources.

By introducing various efficiencies and additional functionality, **EasyLoader** can make data access faster by up to an order of magnitude, removing hidden data bottlenecks from model training!

## Usage

Three flavours of `EasyLoader` and `EasyDataset` class are provided.

### Arrays
`ArrayDataset` and `ArrayDataLoader` are for loading from NumPy arrays. The inputted `arrays` can either be a single array or a list of arrays of equal length. Like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import ArrayDataset
from easyloader.loader import ArrayDataLoader

ds = DFDataset(df, arrays=[array_1, array_2])
X = ds[:10]

dl = DFDataLoader(df, arrays=array_1)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

### DataFrames
`DFDataset` and `DFDataLoader` are for loading from Pandas DataFrames. The inputted `columns` can be used to specify which columns to extract. Like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import DFDataset
from easyloader.loader import DFDataLoader

ds = DFDataset(df, columns=[['column_1', 'column_2'], 'column_3'])
X, y = ds[:10]

dl = DFDataLoader(df, columns=['column_1', 'column_2'], batch_size=10)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

If `columns` is left blank, all columns are used.

### H5 files
`H5Dataset` and`H5DataLoader` for loading from an H5 File. The `keys` attribute can be used to specify one or more keys to load, like this:

```
from easyloader.dataset import H5Dataset
from easyloader.loader import H5DataLoader

ds = H5Dataset(h5_file, keys=['key_1', 'key_2'])
values = ds[:10]

dl = H5DataLoader(h5_file, keys='key_1', batch_size=10)
for batch in dl:
    print(batch)
```

## Shuffling & sampling

Each `EasyDataset` can be shuffled and sampled directly, modifying the index of the underlying dataset. Separate seeds can be specified for each action, by specifying `sample_seed` and `shuffle_seed`.

Datasets can be sampled using `ds.sample(sample_fraction=sample_fraction)`, or sampled on creation using the same argument. This can be useful when restricting to a small subset of the data for protyping.

Datasets can be shuffled using `ds.shuffle()`. In `DataLoaders`, if `shuffle=True` is set, then the data will be shuffled at the beginning of every loop of the data.


## Grains

For H5 files, data is most efficiently loaded when it is contiguous on the disk. When data is shuffled, the chances that any two samples that are adjacent in the batch are also adjacent on the disk is low. To solve this, we use *graining*. Rather then shuffling or sampling fully, we break the data into grains and shuffle/sample those grains [(see this blog post for more info)](https://towardsdatascience.com/reading-h5-files-faster-with-pytorch-datasets-3ff86938cc).

It massively increases the speed of H5 access, generally without affecting model performance. To use graining with any data set, just set the `grain_size` parameter to anything higher than `1`.

For example, graining with `grain_size=10` improved the access speed for this H5 data set 13x:

## Keeping track of IDs

It's often useful to keep track of the which sequences were used in each training or testing run.

For this purpose, both `EasyDataset` and `EasyDataLoader` classes have an `ids` attribute:
- For `ArrayDataset`/`ArrayDataLoader`, this is inputted as a list of IDs
- For `DFDataset`/`DFDataLoader`, this also be specified as a column in the H5 file.
- For `H5Dataset`/`H5DataLoader`, this can be specified as a key in the H5 file.

In all cases, the numeric index will be used if this argument is left blank.

The IDs are accessed using `ds.ids` and will update whenever the data is shuffled or sampled. Wow!
