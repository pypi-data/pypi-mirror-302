
# Getting Started with Words API

## Introduction

Words API lets you retrieve information about English words, including definitions, synonyms, rhymes, pronunciation, syllables, and frequency of usage. It also can tell you about relationships between words, for instance that “math” has categories like “algebra” and “geometry”, or that a “finger” is part of a “hand”.

## Install the Package

The package is compatible with Python versions `3 >=3.7, <= 3.11`.
Install the package from PyPi using the following pip command:

```python
pip install test-words-api-client-sdk==0.0.1
```

You can also view the package at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/test-words-api-client-sdk/0.0.1

## Test the SDK

You can test the generated SDK and the server with test cases. `unittest` is used as the testing framework and `pytest` is used as the test runner. You can run the tests as follows:

Navigate to the root directory of the SDK and run the following commands

```
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Initialize the API Client

**_Note:_** Documentation for the client can be found [here.](doc/client.md)

The following parameters are configurable for the API Client:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| `http_client_instance` | `HttpClient` | The Http Client passed from the sdk user for making requests |
| `override_http_client_configuration` | `bool` | The value which determines to override properties of the passed Http Client from the sdk user |
| `http_call_back` | `HttpCallBack` | The callback value that is invoked before and after an HTTP call is made to an endpoint |
| `timeout` | `float` | The value to use for connection timeout. <br> **Default: 60** |
| `max_retries` | `int` | The number of times to retry an endpoint call if it fails. <br> **Default: 0** |
| `backoff_factor` | `float` | A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try. <br> **Default: 2** |
| `retry_statuses` | `Array of int` | The http statuses on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: [408, 413, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 521, 522, 524]** |
| `retry_methods` | `Array of string` | The http methods on which retry is to be done. <br> **Default: ['GET', 'PUT']** |
| `custom_header_authentication_credentials` | [`CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials`](__base_path/auth/custom-header-signature.md) | The credential object for Custom Header Signature |

The API client can be initialized as follows:

```python
client = WordsapiClient(
    custom_header_authentication_credentials=CustomHeaderAuthenticationCredentials(
        x_rapid_api_key='X-RapidAPI-Key'
    ),
    environment=Environment.PRODUCTION
)
```

## Authorization

This API uses the following authentication schemes.

* [`RapidAPI-Key (Custom Header Signature)`](__base_path/auth/custom-header-signature.md)
