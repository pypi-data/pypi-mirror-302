"""Updates older project cards to current format.

If you have a project card that isn't successfully converting using this script or its wrapper,
`/bin/update_project_cards.py`, please open an issue on the projectcard repo with the card.

If you want to address it yourself, please open a pull request with:

1. The card that isn't converting (or similar) added to `/tests/data/cards/` with v0 at end of name.
2. Update the below releveant functions or add a new function and append it to the
    set of functions executed in `update_schema_for_card` function.
3. Validate that the card is converting successfully using the tests in `test_conversion_script.py`.
